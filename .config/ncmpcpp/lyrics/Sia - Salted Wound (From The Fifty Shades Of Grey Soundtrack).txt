Don't let love get in the way
Feel the fear and do it anyway
Take a chance, no it wasn't what you know
Take her hand and don't let go

Oh, oh, oh
And you can do it,
Don't break
Yeah, you'll push through it,
You're safe
Yes, you can do it
Don't break
Yeah, you'll push for through it,
You're safe

Tell her all of how you feel,
Give her everything she needs to hear
Give your heart a second chance,
And she will see that you're a good man

Oh, oh, oh
And you can do it,
Don't break
Yeah, you'll push through it,
You're safe
Yeah, you can do it

Don't break
Yeah, you'll push through it,
You're safe
Yes, you can do it,
Don't break
Yeah, you'll push through it,
You're safe
