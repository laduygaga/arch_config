There's nothing rich folks love more
Than going downtown and slummin' it with the poor.
They pull up in their carriages and gawk
At the students in the common
Just to watch them talk.
Take Philip Schuyler: the man is loaded.
Uh-oh, but little does he know that
His daughters, Peggy, Angelica, Eliza
Sneak into the city just to watch all the guys at—
Work, work!
Angelica!
Work, work!
Eliza!
And Peggy!
The Schuyler sisters!
Angelica! Peggy! Eliza! Work!
Daddy said to be home by sundown.
Daddy doesn't need to know.
Daddy said not to go downtown.
Like I said, you're free to go.
But–look around, look around, the
Revolution's happening in New York (New York)
Angelica! Work!
It's bad enough daddy wants to go to war.
People shouting in the square.
It's bad enough there'll be violence on our shore.
New ideas in the air.
Look around, look around—
Angelica, remind me what we're looking for...
She's lookin' for me!
Eliza, I'm lookin' for a mind at work. (Work, Work)
I'm lookin for a mind at work! (Work, work!)
I'm lookin for a mind at work! (Work, work!)
Whooaaaaa! Whooaaaaa! (Work!)
Wooh! There's nothin' like summer in the city.
Someone in a rush next to someone lookin' pretty.
Excuse me, miss, I know it's not funny
But your perfume smells like your daddy's got money.
Why you slummin' in the city in your fancy heels
You searchin for an urchin who can give you ideals?
Burr, you disgust me.
Ah, so you've discussed me.
I'm a trust fund, baby, you can trust me!
I've been reading Common Sense by Thomas Paine.
So men say that I'm intense or I'm insane.
You want a revolution? I want a revelation
So listen to my declaration:
"We hold these truths to be self-evident
That all men are created equal"
And when I meet Thomas Jefferson,
I'm 'a compel him to include women in the sequel! (Work!)
Look around, look around at how
Lucky we are to be alive right now!
Look around, look around at how
Lucky we are to be alive right now!
History is happening in Manhattan and we
Just happen to be in the greatest city in the world!
In the greatest city in the world!
Cuz I've been reading Common Sense by Thomas Paine. (Look around, look around)
So men say that I'm intense or I'm insane.
(The revolution's happening in New York)
You want a revolution? I want a revelation
So listen to my declaration
We hold these truths to be self evident
That all men are created equal
Look around, Look around
At how lucky we are to be alive right now!
History is happening in Manhattan and we just
Happen to be
In the greatest city in the world
In the greatest city-
In the greatest city in the world!
Work, work!
Angelica! (Work, work!)
Eliza! (Work, work!) And Peggy!
The Schuyler sisters! (Work, work!)
We're looking for a mind at
Work, work! Hey!
Work, work! Hey!
Work, work! Whoa! Hey! Hey!
Work, work! Hey! Hey! Hey!

World
