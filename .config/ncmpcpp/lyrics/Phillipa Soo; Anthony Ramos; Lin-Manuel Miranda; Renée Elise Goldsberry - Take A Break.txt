[Eliza (Philip):]
Un deux trois quatre
Cinq six sept huit neuf (Un deux trois quatre)
(Cinq six sept huit neuf)
Good! Un deux trois quatre
Cinq six sept huit neuf (Un deux trois quatre)
(Cinq six sept huit neuf)
Sept huit neuf
(Sept huit neuf)
Sept huit neuf
(Sept huit neuf)

[Eliza and Philip:]
One two three four five six seven eight nine!

[Hamilton:]
My dearest, Angelica
"Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day"
I trust you'll understand the reference to
Another Scottish tragedy without my having to name the play
They think me Macbeth, and ambition is my folly
I'm a polymath, a pain in the ass, a massive pain
Madison is Banquo, Jefferson's Macduff
And Birnam Wood is Congress on its way to Dunsinane

[Hamilton/Angelica:]
And there you are, an ocean away
Do you have to live an ocean away?
Thoughts of you subside
Then I get another letter
And I cannot put the notion away…

[Eliza:]
Take a break

[Hamilton:]
I am on my way

[Eliza:]
There's a little surprise before supper
And it cannot wait

[Hamilton:]
I'll be there in just a minute, save my plate

[Eliza:]
Alexander

[Hamilton:]
Okay, okay

[Eliza:]
Your son is nine years old today
He has something he'd like to say
He's been practicing all day
Philip, take it away

[Philip (Hamilton):]
Daddy, daddy, look
My name is Philip
I am a poet
I wrote this poem just to show it
And I just turned nine
You can write rhymes
But you can't write mine
(What!)
I practice French
And play piano with my mother
(Uh-huh!)
I have a sister, but I want a little brother
(Okay!)
My daddy's trying to start America's bank
Un deux trois quatre cinq!
(Bravo!)

[Eliza:]
Take a break

[Hamilton:]
Hey, our kid is pretty great

[Eliza:]
Run away with us for the summer
Let's go upstate

[Hamilton:]
Eliza, I've got so much on my plate

[Eliza:]
We can all go stay with my father
There's a lake I know…

[Hamilton:]
I know

[Eliza:]
In a nearby park

[Hamilton:]
I'd love to go

[Eliza:]
You and I can go when the night gets dark…

[Hamilton:]
I will try to get away

[Angelica:]
My dearest Alexander
You must get through to Jefferson
Sit down with him and compromise
Don't stop 'til you agree
Your fav'rite older sister
Angelica, reminds you
There's someone in your corner all the way across the sea

In a letter I received from you two weeks ago
I noticed a comma in the middle of a phrase
It changed the meaning. Did you intend this?
One stroke and you've consumed my waking days
It says:

[Hamilton/Angelica:]
"My dearest Angelica"

[Angelica:]
With a comma after "dearest"
You've written

[Hamilton and Angelica:]
"My dearest, Angelica."

[Angelica:]
Anyway, all this to say
I'm coming home this summer
At my sister's invitation
I'll be there with your fam'ly
If you make your way upstate
I know you're very busy
I know your work's important
But I'm crossing the ocean and I just can't wait

[Hamilton and Angelica:]
You won't be an ocean away
You will only be a moment away…

[Eliza:]
Alexander, come downstairs
Angelica's arriving today!

[Eliza:]
Angelica!

[Angelica:]
Eliza!

[Hamilton:]
The Schuyler sisters!

[Angelica:]
Alexander

[Hamilton:]
Hi

[Angelica:]
It's good to see your face

[Eliza:]
Angelica, tell this man John Adams spends the summer with his family

[Hamilton:]
Angelica, tell my wife John Adams doesn't have a real job anyway

[Angelica:]
…you're not joining us? Wait

[Hamilton:]
I'm afraid I cannot join you upstate

[Angelica:]
Alexander, I came all this way

[Eliza:]
She came all this way

[Angelica:]
All this way

[Eliza and Angelica:]
Take a break

[Hamilton:]
You know I have to get my plan through Congress

[Eliza and Angelica:]
Run away with us for the summer
Let's go upstate

[Hamilton:]
I lose my job if we don't get this plan through Congress

[Eliza and Angelica:]
We can all go stay with our father

[Eliza (Angelica):]
There's a lake I know
(I know I'll miss your face)
In a nearby park
(Screw your courage to the sticking place)
You and I can go
(Eliza's right)
Take a break and get away (Take a break)
(Run away with us for the summer)
Let's go upstate (Let's go upstate)
Where we can stay
(We can all go stay with our father)
(If you take your time)
Look around, look around
(You will make your mark)
At how lucky we are to be alive right now
(Close your eyes and dream)
We can go
When the night gets dark (When the night gets dark)
Take a break (Take a break)

[Hamilton:]
I have to get my plan through Congress
I can't stop until I get this plan through Congress
