[Bruno Mars:]
This one's for you and me, living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters

[Eminem:]
By the time you hear this I will have already spiraled up
I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you I would duck, or get struck, like lightning,
Fighters keep fighting, put your lighters up, point 'em skyward uh
Had a dream, I was king, I woke up, still king
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking,
'Til nobody else even fucking feels me, 'til it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fucking illest in this music
There is or there ever will be, disagree?
Feel free, but from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
Only thing I ever gave up's using no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick but you cocks are slick
Popping shit on how you flipped your life around, crock-o-shit
Who you dicks tryna kid?
Flip "dick", you did opposite
You stayed the same,
'Cause "cock" backwards is still "cock" you pricks
I love it when I tell 'em shove it
'Cause it wasn't that, long ago when Marshall sat, flustered lacked luster
'Cause he couldn't cut mustard, muster up, nothing
Brain fuzzy, 'cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzzin'
Now you wonder why he does it, how he does it
Wasn't 'cause he had buzzards circlin' around his head
Waiting for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it 'cause them bitches wrote him off
Little hussy ass, scuzzes, fuck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it
What difference it make?
What it take to get it through your thick skulls
That this ain't some bullshit
People don't usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in
Just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switch blade to a hater's ribcage
And let it be known that from this day forward
I wanna just say thanks 'cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let 'em Bics raise 'cause I came with 5'9" but I feel like I'm 6'8â€³!

[Bruno Mars:]
This one's for you and me, living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters

[Royce Da 5'9":]
By the time you hear this I'll probably already be outtie
I advance like going from toting iron to going and buying 4 or 5 of the homies the iron man Audi
My daddy told me slow down, boy, you're goin' to blow it
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute
To tell Shady I love him the same way that he did, Dr. Dre on the Chronic
Tell him how real he is or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him for him to know it
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I write 'til he can march right into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's Lebron's jersey in 20 years
I'll stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up
It's 'bout to be a scary drop
'Cause what goes up, must come down
You going down on something you don't wanna see, like a hairy box
Every hour, happy hour now
Life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cat's meow, ow
Classic cow, always down for the catchweight like Pacquiao
Ya'll are doomed
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself and autotunes
'Cause now I'm in the Aston
I went from having my city locked up
To getting treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic
Compared to a weed high
And y'all niggas that's gossipin' like bitches on a radio and TV
See me, we fly
Y'all bugging out like Wendy Williams staring at a beehive
And how real is that
I remember signing my first deal and now I'm the second best, I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag...

[Bruno Mars:]
You and I know what it's like to be kicked down
Forced to fight
But tonight, we're alright
So hold up your lights
Let it shine
'Cause, this one's for you and me, living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters
