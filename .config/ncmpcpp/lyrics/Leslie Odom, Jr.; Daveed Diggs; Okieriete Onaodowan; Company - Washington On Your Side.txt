[Company:]
1776. New York City.

[Hamilton:]
Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?

[Burr:]
That depends. Who's asking?

[Hamilton:]
Oh, well, sure, sir
I'm Alexander Hamilton, I'm at your service, sir
I have been looking for you

[Burr:]
I'm getting nervous

[Hamilton:]
Sir…
I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. It's a blur, sir. He handles the financials?

[Burr:]
You punched the bursar

[Hamilton:]
Yes!
I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, I'm not stupid.
So how'd you do it? How'd you graduate so fast?

[Burr:]
It was my parents' dying wish before they passed

[Hamilton:]
You're an orphan. Of course! I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we're worth more
Than anyone bargained for…

[Burr:]
Can I buy you a drink?

[Hamilton:]
That would be nice

[Burr:]
While we're talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less

[Hamilton:]
What?

[Burr:]
Smile more

[Hamilton:]
Ha

[Burr:]
Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for

[Hamilton:]
You can't be serious

[Burr:]
You wanna get ahead?

[Hamilton:]
Yes

[Burr:]
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

[Laurens:]
Yo yo yo yo yo!
What time is it?

[Laurens/Lafayette/Mulligan:]
Show time!

[Burr:]
Like I said…

[Laurens:]
Show time! Show time! Yo!
I'm John Laurens in the place to be!
A two pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm workin' on three, uh!
Those redcoats don't want it with me!
'Cause I will pop chick-a pop these cops 'til I'm free!

[Lafayette:]
Oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say "Bonsoir!"
Tell the King "Casse toi!" Who's the best?
C'est moi!

[Mulligan:]
Brrrah brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin' it, yes I heard ya mother said, "Come again?"

[Lafayette and Laurens:]
Ayyyyy

[Mulligan:]
Lock up ya daughters and horses, of course
It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets…

[Lafayette:]
Wow

[Laurens:]
No more sex, pour me another brew, son!
Let's raise a couple more…

[Laurens/Lafayette/Mulligan:]
To the revolution!

[Laurens:]
Well, if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton college!

[Mulligan:]
Aaron Burr!

[Laurens:]
Give us a verse, drop some knowledge!

[Burr:]
Good luck with that: you're takin' a stand
You spit. I'mma sit. We'll see where we land

[Lafayette/Mulligan:]
Boooo!

[Laurens:]
Burr, the revolution's imminent. What do you stall for?

[Hamilton:]
If you stand for nothing, Burr, what'll you fall for?

[Mulligan/Lafayette/Laurens:]
Ooh

[Laurens:]
Who are you?

[Mulligan:]
Who are you?

[Lafayette:]
Who are you?

[Mulligan/Lafayette/Laurens:]
Ooh, who is this kid? What's he gonna do?
