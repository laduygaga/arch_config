[Hamilton:]
Mr. Vice President
Mr. Madison
Senator Burr
What is this?

[Jefferson:]
We have the check stubs
From separate accounts…

[Madison:]
Almost a thousand dollars, paid in different amounts…

[Burr:]
To a Mr. James Reynolds way back in seventeen ninety-one

[Hamilton:]
Is that what you have? Are you done?

[Madison:]
You are uniquely situated by virtue of your position

[Jefferson:]
Though 'virtue' is not a word I'd apply to this situation

[Madison:]
To seek financial gain, to stray from your sacred mission

[Jefferson:]
And the evidence suggests you've engaged in speculation

[Burr:]
An immigrant embezzling our government funds

[Jefferson/Madison:]
I can almost see the headline, your career is done

[Burr:]
I hope you saved some money for your daughter and sons

[Burr/Jefferson/Madison:]
Ya best g'wan run back where ya come from!

[Hamilton:]
Ha! You don't even know what you're asking me to confess

[Jefferson/Madison/Burr:]
Confess

[Hamilton:]
You have nothing. I don't have to tell you anything at all
Unless

[Jefferson/Madison/Burr:]
Unless

[Hamilton:]
If I can prove that I never broke the law
Do you promise not to tell another soul what you saw?

[Burr:]
No one else was in the room where it happened

[Hamilton:]
Is that a yes?

[Jefferson/Madison/Burr:]
Um, yes

[Burr:]
"Dear Sir, I hope this letter finds you in good health
And in a prosperous enough position to put wealth
In the pockets of people like me: down on their luck
You see, it was my wife who you decided to..."

[Jefferson:]
Whaaaat

[Hamilton:]
She courted me
Escorted me to bed and when she had me in a corner
That's when Reynolds extorted me
For a sordid fee
I paid him quarterly
I may have mortally wounded my prospects
But my papers are orderly!
As you can see I kept a record of every check in my checkered history
Check it again against your list n' see consistency
I never spent a cent that wasn't mine
You sent the dogs after my scent, that's fine
Yes, I have reasons for shame
But I have not committed treason and sullied my good name
As you can see I have done nothing to provoke legal action
Are my answers to your satisfaction?

[Jefferson:]
My God

[Madison:]
Gentlemen, let's go

[Hamilton:]
So?

[Jefferson and Madison:]
The people won't know what we know

[Hamilton:]
Burr!
How do I know you won't use this against me
The next time we go toe to toe?

[Burr:]
Alexander, rumors only grow
And we both know what we know
