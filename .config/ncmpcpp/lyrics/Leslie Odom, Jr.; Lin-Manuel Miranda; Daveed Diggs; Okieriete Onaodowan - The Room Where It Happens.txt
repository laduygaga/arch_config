Ah, Mister Secretary
Mister Burr, sir
Did'ya hear the news about good old General Mercer
No
You know Clermont Street
Yeah
They renamed it after him, the Mercer legacy is secure
Sure
And all he had to do was die
That's a lot less work
We oughta give it a try
Ha
Now how're you gonna get your debt plan through
I guess I'm gonna fin'ly have to listen to you
Really
Talk less, smile more
Ha
Do whatever it takes to get my plan on the Congress floor
Now, Madison and Jefferson are merciless
Well, hate the sin, love the sinner
Hamilton
I'm sorry Burr, I've gotta go
But
Decisions are happening over dinner
Two Virginians and an immigrant walk into a room
Diametric'ly opposed, foes
They emerge with a compromise, having opened doors that were
Previously closed
Bros
The immigrant emerges with unprecedented financial power
A system he can shape however he wants
The Virginians emerge with the nation's capital
And here's the pièce de résistance
No one else was in
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
No one else was in
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
No one really knows how the game is played
The art of the trade
How the sausage gets made
We just assume that it happens
But no one else is in
The room where it happens
Thomas claims
Alexander was on Washington's doorstep one day
In distress 'n disarray
Thomas claims
Alexander said
I've nowhere else to turn
And basic'ly begged me to join the fray
Thomas claims
I approached Madison and said
I know you hate 'im, but let's hear what he has to say
Thomas claims
Well, I arranged the meeting
I arranged the menu, the venue, the seating
But
No one else was in
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
No one else was in
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
No one really knows how the
Parties get to yes
The pieces that are sacrificed in
Ev'ry game of chess
We just assume that it happens
But no one else is in
The room where it happens
Meanwhile
Madison is grappling with the fact that not ev'ry issue can be settled by committee
Meanwhile
Congress is fighting over where to put the capital
It isn't pretty
Then Jefferson approaches with a dinner and invite
And Madison responds with Virginian insight
Maybe we can solve one problem with another and win a victory for the Southerners, in other words
Oh ho
A quid pro quo
I suppose
Wouldn't you like to work a little closer to home
Actually, I would
Well, I propose the Potomac
And you'll provide him his votes
Well, we'll see how it goes
Let's go
No
One else was in
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
No one else was in
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
My God
In God we trust
But we'll never really know what got discussed
Click-boom then it happened
And no one else was in the room where it happened
Alexander Hamilton
What did they say to you to get you to sell New York City down the river
Alexander Hamilton
Did Washington know about the dinner
Was there Presidential pressure to deliver
Alexander Hamilton
Or did you know, even then, it doesn't matter
Where you put the U.S. Capital
'Cause we'll have the banks
We're in the same spot
You got more than you gave
And I wanted what I got
When you got skin in the game, you stay in the game
But you don't get a win unless you play in the game
Oh, you get love for it, you get hate for it
You get nothing if you
Wait for it, wait for it, wait
God help and forgive me
I wanna build
Something that's gonna
Outlive me
What do you want, Burr
What do you want, Burr
If you stand for nothing
Burr, then what do you fall for
I
Wanna be in
The room where it happens
The room where it happens
I
Wanna be in
The room where it happens
The room where it happens
I
Wanna be
In the room where it happens
I
I wanna be in the room
Oh
Oh
I wanna be in
The room where it happens
The room where it happens
The room where it happens
I wanna be in the room
Where it happens
The room where it happens
The room where it happen
The art of the compromise
Hold your nose and close your eyes
We want our leaders to save the day
But we don't get a say in what they trade away
We dream of a brand new start
But we dream in the dark for the most part
Dark as a tomb where it happens
I've got to be in
The room (where it happens)
I've got to be (the room where it happens)
I've got to be (the room where it happens)
Oh, I've got to be in
The room where it happens
I've got to be, I've gotta be, I've gotta be
In the room
