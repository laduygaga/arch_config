You gotta know and see that we
Are too clever to be human
We all are absolute predators
We do not even have any enemies
But maybe an animal watching us now
Takes a vow: "Someday we will bring them down!"

I wish that we could hide away
Wear this flesh and rule the world
Through all our lies - Our disguise
But they'll never get to realize
They were born with this fate
Beating hearts slowly dying
But still, I wonder when will they find out?
That at a point there is no return
Our reign will prevail

I keep calling out your name
So you know I'm still here to wipe away your tears
If we fall, at least we're falling as one in the end
Let me take your last breath
