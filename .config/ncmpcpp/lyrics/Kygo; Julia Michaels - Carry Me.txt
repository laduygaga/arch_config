Like a kid and a teddy bear
Like a leaf blowing in the air
Could you carry me?
Could you carry me?

Like a flag after a war
When you're gone and when you're first born
Could you carry me?
Could you carry me?

Cause I don't know how we
How we got so far, you and me
Almost like there's oceans between us, us

So I need to know
Could you carry me?
Back into your heart again
Could you carry me?
Running to your distant hands
Could you carry me?
Running back to where we started from
Could you carry me?

On and on and on, on, on, on
On and on and on, on, on, on
On and on and on, on, on, on
On and on, could you carry me?
Back to where we started from

Remember when we danced all night
Parking lots and velvet skies
I was there for you
And you were there for me

Heavy tongue when we start a fight
And make love to the morning light
I was there for you
And you were there for me

So I don't know how we
How we got so far, you and me
Almost like there's oceans between us, us

So I need to know
Could you carry me?
Back into your heart again
Could you carry me?
Running to your distant hands
Could you carry me?
Running back to where we started from
Could you carry me?

On and on and on, on, on, on
On and on and on, on, on, on
On and on and on, on, on, on
On and on, could you carry me?
Back to where we started from

On, on, on
On and on and on, on, on, on
On and on and on, on, on, on
On and on and on, on, on, on
On and on and on, on, on, on
On and on and on, on, on, on
On and on and on, on, on, on
On and on, could you carry me?
Back to where we started from

On and on and on, on, on, on
On and on and on, on, on, on
On and on and on, on, on, on
On and on, could you carry me
Back to where we started from
