I really wanna stop
But I just got the taste for it
I feel like I could fly with the boy on the moon
So honey hold my hand, you like making me wait for it
I feel like I could die walking up to the room, oh yeah

Late night, watching television
But how'd we get in this position?
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something

I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?

Oh, did I say too much?
I'm so in my head
When we're out of touch
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?

It's like everything you say is a sweet revelation
All I wanna do is get into your head
Yeah we could stay alone, you and me, in this temptation
Sipping on your lips, hanging on by a thread, baby

Late night, watching television
But how'd we get in this position?
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something

I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?

Oh, did I say too much?
I'm so in my head
When we're out of touch (When we're out of touch)
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?

Who gave you eyes like that?
Said you could keep them?
I don't know how to act
Or if I should be leaving
I'm running out of time
Going out of my mind
I need to tell you something
Yeah, I need to tell you something

I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?

Oh, did I say too much? (Did I say too much?)
I'm so in my head (I'm so in my head)
When we're out of touch (When we're out of touch!)
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?

I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
(Yeah, I need to tell you something)
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you. Do you want me? Do you want me too?
