[Burr:]
How does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower
Somehow defeat a global superpower?
How does King George underestimate his haters?

[King George III:]
Once we beat the traitors, we'll be greeted as liberators!

[Company:]
Yay!

[Burr:]
Now, turns out we have a secret weapon!
An immigrant you know and love who's unafraid to step in!
He's constantly confusin', confoundin' the British henchmen
Ev'ryone give it up for America's favorite fighting Frenchman!

[Company:]
Lafayette!

[Lafayette:]
I'm taking this horse by the reins makin'
Redcoats redder with bloodstains

[Company:]
Lafayette!

[Lafayette:]
And I'm never gonna stop 'til I make 'em
Drop, burn 'em up and scatter their remains, I'm..

[Company:]
Lafayette!

[Lafayette:]
Watch me escapin' em! Engagin' em!
Enragin' em! I'm...

[Company:]
Lafayette!

[Lafayette:]
I go to France for more funds

[Company:]
Lafayette!

[Lafayette:]
I come back with more

[Lafayette and Ensemble:]
Guns
And ships
And so the balance shifts

[Washington:]
We rendezvous with Rochambeau, consolidate their gifts

[Lafayette:]
We can end the war at Yorktown, cut them off at sea, but
If we're to succeed, there's someone else we need:

[Washington:]
Please

[Washington and Company:]
Hamilton!

[Lafayette:]
Sir, he knows what to do in a trench
Ingenuitive and fluent in French, I mean..

[Washington and Company:]
Hamilton!

[Lafayette:]
Sir, you're gonna have to use him eventually
What's he gonna do on the bench? I mean..

[Washington and Company:]
Hamilton!

[Lafayette:]
No one has more resilience
Or matches my practical tactical brilliance..

[Washington and Company:]
Hamilton!

[Lafayette:]
You wanna fight for your land back?

[Washington and Company:]
Hamilton!

[Lafayette:]
Ya need your right hand man back!
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ya need your right hand man back
Get your right hand man back
Get your right hand man back!

[Washington:]
Alexander Hamilton
Troops are waiting in the field for you
If you join us right now, together we can turn the tide
Alexander Hamilton
I have soldiers who will yield for you
If we manage to get this right
They'll surrender by early light
The world will never be the same, Alexander...
