You got all the numbers to gamble
You have all the options to play
I sit at the end of the table, afraid that you will look away
Cause your face tell the signs and your eyes leave me naked
I strip to the bone, if it's wrong, well just say it
This one time I'll take you for granted
The one time I take you for granted

Got to stand upright, head up high, it's about getting by
That's what, what Im gonna do, what
Forty three, the seconds running down to be

The winner of the lottery
Billion battles in our history
And everyone's reminding me
There'll always be a casualty
The winner of the

I'm not expecting poetry
Just a little, just a little, just a little chemistry

Did you go for the look in the mirror
'Till the secrets were all you could see
Sometimes their picture is clearer
Much more than you want it to be
Cause the time is the clock and we'll run out of chances
Bound to be heard, better crashed and be stranded
This one time you take me for granted
This one time you take me for granted

Gotta wake up now, say goodbye
Make it right, you know what
It's what, what you gotta do, what
Thirty-three, the seconds running down to be

The winner of the lottery
Billion battles in our history
And everyone's reminding me
There'll always be a casualty
The winner of the

I'm not expecting poetry
Just a little, just a little, just a little chemistry
Chemistry
