Broke down, thought that I would drown
Hope that I'd be found, 'fore I hit the ground
Some days out the corner of my eye, hey
Saw you weeping, saw you creeping, saw you sneaking
In the shadows long the fear so strong
Saw you out the corner of my eye

Don't come for me today
I'm feeling good, let me savor it
Don't come for me today
I'm feeling good and I remember when

You came to take me away
So close I was to heaven's gates
But, no, baby, no, baby, not today
Oh, you tried to track me down
You followed me like the darkest cloud
But, no, baby, no, baby, not today (reaper)
Oh, reaper (reaper)
Oh, no, baby, no, baby, not today (reaper)
Oh, reaper (reaper)
Oh, no, baby, no, baby, not today

So come back when I'm good and old
I got drinks to drink, and men to hold
I got good things to do with my life, yeah
Oh, I wanna dance in the open breeze
Feel the wind in my hair, hear the ocean sing
I got good things to feel in my life, yeah

Don't come for me today
I'm feeling good, let me savour it
Don't come for me today
I'm feeling good, I remember when

You came to take me away
So close I was to heaven's gates
But, no, baby, no, baby, not today
Oh, you tried to track me down
You followed me like the darkest cloud
But, no, baby, no, baby, not today (reaper)
Oh, reaper (reaper)
Oh, no, baby, no, baby, not today (reaper)
Oh, reaper
Oh, no, baby, no, baby, not today
