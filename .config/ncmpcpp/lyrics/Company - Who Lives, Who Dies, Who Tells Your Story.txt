[Washington:]
Let me tell you what I wish I'd known
When I was young and dreamed of glory
You have no control:

[Washington and Company:]
Who lives
Who dies
Who tells your story?

[Burr:]
President Jefferson:

[Jefferson:]
I'll give him this: his financial system is a work of genius
I couldn't undo it if I tried
And I tried

[Washington and Company:]
Who lives
Who dies
Who tells your story?

[Burr:]
President Madison:

[Madison:]
He took our country from bankruptcy to prosperity
I hate to admit it, but he doesn't get enough credit for all the credit he gave us

[Washington and Company:]
Who lives
Who dies
Who tells your story?

[Angelica:]
Every other founding father's story gets told
Every other founding father gets to grow old

[Burr:]
But when you're gone, who remembers your name?
Who keeps your flame?

[Burr and men (Angelica and women):]
Who tells your story?
(Who tells your story?)
Who tells your story? (Your story?)

[Women:]
Eliza

[Eliza:]
I put myself back in the narrative

[Women:]
Eliza

[Eliza:]
I stop wasting time on tears
I live another fifty years
It's not enough

[Company:]
Eliza

[Eliza:]
I interview every soldier who fought by your side

[Mulligan/Lafayette/Laurens:]
She tells our story

[Eliza:]
I try to make sense of your thousands of pages of writings
You really do write like you're running out of

[Eliza and Company:]
Time

[Eliza:]
I rely on

[Eliza and Angelica:]
Angelica

[Eliza:]
While she's alive

[Eliza and Angelica:]
We tell your story

[Eliza:]
She is buried in Trinity Church

[Eliza and Angelica:]
Near you

[Eliza:]
When I needed her most, she was right on

[Eliza and Company:]
Time

[Eliza:]
And I'm still not through
I ask myself, "What would you do if you had more?"

[Eliza and Company:]
Time

[Eliza:]
The Lord, in his kindness
He gives me what you always wanted
He gives me more

[Eliza and Company:]
Time

[Eliza:]
I raise funds in D.C. for the Washington Monument

[Washington:]
She tells my story

[Eliza:]
I speak out against slavery
You could have done so much more if you only had

[Eliza and Company:]
Time

[Eliza:]
And when my time is up, have I done enough?

[Eliza and Company:]
Will they tell our story?

[Eliza:]
Oh. Can I show you what I'm proudest of?

[Company:]
The orphanage

[Eliza:]
I established the first private orphanage in New York City

[Company:]
The orphanage

[Eliza:]
I help to raise hundreds of children
I get to see them growing up

[Company:]
The orphanage

[Eliza:]
In their eyes I see you, Alexander
I see you every

[Eliza and Company:]
Time

[Eliza:]
And when my time is up
Have I done enough?

[Eliza and Company:]
Will they tell our story?

[Eliza:]
Oh, I can't wait to see you again
It's only a matter of

[Eliza and Company:]
Time

[Company:]
Will they tell your story?
(Time…)
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story?
(Time…)
Will they tell your story?
(Time…)
Who lives, who dies
[Full Company:]
Who tells your story?
