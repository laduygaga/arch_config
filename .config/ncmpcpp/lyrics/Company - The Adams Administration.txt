[Burr:]
How does Hamilton the short-tempered
Protean creator of the Coast Guard
Founder of the New York Post
Ardently abuse his cab'net post
Destroy his reputation?
Welcome, folks, to

[Burr/Company:]
The Adams administration!

[Burr:]
Jefferson's the runner-up, which makes him the Vice President

[Jefferson:]
Washington can't help you now, no more mister nice President

[Burr:]
Adams fires Hamilton
Privately calls him "creole bastard" in his taunts

[Jefferson:]
Say what?!

[Burr:]
Hamilton publishes his response

[Hamilton:]
Sit down, John, you fat mother[*bleep*]

[Burr:]
Hamilton is out of control

[Madison:]
This is great!
He's out of power
He holds no office
And he just destroyed President John Adams, the only other significant member of his party

[Jefferson:]
Hamilton's a host unto himself
As long as he can hold a pen, he's a threat
Let's let him know what we know
