Hey, said a hustler's work is never through
We makin' it 'cause we make it move
The only thing we know how to do
Said it's the only thing we know how to do

Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard.
We work hard, play hard
Keep partyin' like it's your job

Come on baby and drop it (OK)
Scrub the floor or just mop it (OK)
Show these gangsters how you pop lock it (OK)
Don't care what you got in your pocket (OK)
I get the way that you rockin'
Flip that thang thang don't stop it
Wanna just bang bang and pop it
While the club crowded just watch you (work it out)

Got a gang of cash and it's going all on the bar (now work it out)
And it's going fast cause I feel like a superstar (now work it out)
And you may not have it, I might have just broke the law (now work it out)
It's your turn to grab it, now make this whole thing yours (now work it out)

Some pressure that flicking plush (OK)
Ladies can't get enough (OK)
Got my fitness, all looking buff (OK)
And all my people with me, I trust (OK)
Holdin' down for my city
If they askin' you, I'm not guilty
All the thing that I'm guilty of is making you rock with me (work it out)
