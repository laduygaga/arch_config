Party rock
Let's go!

Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
And we gon' make you lose your mind
Everybody just have a good time (clap!)

Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
(I can feel it baby!)
And we gon' make you lose your mind
We just wanna see you... shake that!

In the club party rock, lookin' for your girl,
She on my jock non-stop when we're in the spot
Booty move her weight like she on the block
Where the drank? I gots to know
Tight jeans, tattoo 'cause I'm rock and roll
Half-black half-white domino
Gain the money Oprah Doe!

Yo!
I'm running through these hoes like Drano
I got that devilish flow rock and roll no halo
We party rock! Yeah, that's the crew that I'm repping
On a rise to the top no lead/Led in our Zeppelin
Hey!

Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
And we gon' make you lose your mind
Everybody just have a good time

Let's go

Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
(I can feel it baby!)
And we gon' make you lose your mind
We just wanna see you... shake that!

Every day I'm shuffling
Shuffling shuffling

Step up fast
And be the first girl to make me throw this cash
We get money, don't be mad,
Now stop â€“ hating's bad

One more shot for us
(Another round)
Please fill up my cup
(Don't mess around)
We just wanna see
(You shake it now)
Now you're home with me
(You're naked now)

Get up get down put your hands up to the sound [3x]
Put your hands up to the sound [2x]
Get up [9x]

Put your hands up! [4x]

Party rock is in the house tonight (put your hands up!)
Everybody just have a good time (put your hands up!)
And we gon' make you lose your mind (put your hands up!)
Everybody just have a good good good time

Put your hands up
I can feel it, baby!
Put your hands up
Put your hands up

Shake that!
Every day I'm shuffling

Put your put your
Put your put your
Put your put your
Put your put your
Put your hands up
Your hands up
Put your hands up
