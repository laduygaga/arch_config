[Washington:]
I was younger than you are now
When I was given my first command
I led my men straight into a massacre
I witnessed their deaths firsthand
I made every mistake
And felt the shame rise in me
And even now I lie awake

[Washington (Laurens/Mulligan):]
Knowing history has its eyes on me (Whoa oh oh…)
(Whoa…)
(Whoa…)
(Yeah)

[Hamilton/Washington (Company):]
History has its eyes on me (Whoa oh oh…)
(Whoa…)
(Whoa…)
(Yeah)

[Washington:]
Let me tell you what I wish I'd known
When I was young and dreamed of glory
You have no control

[Washington And Company:]
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story

[Washington:]
I know that we can win
I know that greatness lies in you
But remember from here on in

[Washington/Hamilton and men (Ensemble):]
History has its eyes on you (Whoa oh oh…)
(Whoa…)
(Whoa…)

[Full Company:]
History has its eyes on you
