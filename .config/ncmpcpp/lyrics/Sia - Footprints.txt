I've fallen through the floor again
Crashed into the basement
The pain was swallowing me
I was like a lead balloon
I couldn't even get up to turn
The lights on
The dark was swallowing me

Lord knows you can't trust your head
When you're standing on the edge
Of breaking down
Lord knows you can't trust your head
When you're hanging by a thread
I was breaking down

And I saw only two footprints in the sand
Thought you'd abandoned me and
Let go of my hand
But you were carrying me
Carrying me to safety
Two footprints, your footprints in the sand
Two footprints, two footprints, your footprints in the sand
Two footprints, your footprints in the sand

Oh, I forgot the things I knew
It was I who'd abandoned you
Forgive me, I was lost in doubt
Who would never've left my side
Picked me up when I thought I would die
You helped me, and I was found

Lord knows you can't trust your head
When you're standing on the edge
Of breaking down
Lord knows you can't trust your head
When you're hanging by a thread
I was breaking down

Only two footprints in the sand
Thought you'd abandoned me and
Let go of my hand
But you were carrying me
Carrying me to safety
Two footprints, your footprints in the sand

Only two footprints in the sand
Thought you'd abandoned me and
Let go of my hand
But you were carrying me
Carrying me to safety
Two footprints, your footprints in the sand

Two footprints, two footprints, your footprints in the sand
Two footprints, your footprints in the sand
