Sorry I ain't got no money I'm not trying to be funny but I left it all at home today
You can call me what you wanna I ain't giving you a dollar this time I ain't gonna run away
You might knock me down, you might knock me down, but I will get back up again
You can call it how you wanna I ain't giving you a dollar this time I ain't gonna run away (run away, run away)

This time, this time, this time
This time I ain't gonna run, run, run, run
Not this time, not this time
This time I ain't gonna run, run, run, run
Not this time, not this time
Not this time, not this time (time)
