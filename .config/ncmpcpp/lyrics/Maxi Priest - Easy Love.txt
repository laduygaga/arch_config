Baby I've been up and down
This whole world I've been around
Something special in you I've found
You lift me up when I am down

You make it easy
Easy to love ya baby
You make it easy
Easy to love ya baby

Girl I know you must be getting tired of the same old line
So listen to me trust I ain't never gonna waste your time
When ever emotion bust whenever you cross my mind
See thought I'd seen it all before
But you got something that I can't deny

Baby I've been up and down
This whole world I've been around
Something special in you I've found
You lift me up when I am down

You make it easy
Easy to love ya baby
You make it easy
Easy to love ya baby

Girl loving you is so easy...
Loving you is so easy...

See I've been living it on my own for the longest time
And everything it seems so easy ever since you came into my life
And I don't really know the reason but I thank God every night
And then I say a little prayer for you baby don't ever change your style

Baby I've been up and down
This whole world I've been around
Something special in you I've found
You lift me up when I am down

You make it easy
Easy to love ya baby
You make it easy
Easy to love ya baby

Girl loving you is so easy...
Loving you is so easy...
