Do you know [3x]

Do you know what it feels like
Loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away.
(Do you know [3x])
Do you know what it feels like
To be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed.

Do you know [4x]
Do ya

If birds flying south is a sign of changes
At least you can predict this every year.
Love, you never know the minute it ends suddenly
I can't get it to speak

Maybe if I knew all the things that took to save us
I could fix the pain that bleeds inside of me
Look in your eyes to see the same about me
I'm standing on the edge and I don't know what else to give.

Do you know what it feels like
Loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away.

How can I love you [4x]
If you just don't talk to me, babe.

Flowing through my head
Is the question "Is she needing
Another side of a man I cannot be?".
Looking at the last 3 years like I did,
I could never see us ending like this.

(Do you know)
Seeing your face no more on my pillow
Is a scene that's never happened to me.
(Do you know)
But after this episode I don't see,
You can never tell how the next thing life could be

Do you know what it feels like
Loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away.

Loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away
