You take me down
Spin me around
You got me running all the lights
Don't make a sound
Talk to me now
Let me inside your mind

I don't know what you're thinking sugar
But I just got that feeling sugar
I can hear the sirens burning
Red lights turning
I can't turn back now
So hold on tight

I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby this is getting serious
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Detain the dangerous
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Show me your soul
I gotta know
Bet that you're beautiful inside
Toes on the glass
Car moving fast
Come take the wheel and drive

I don't know what you're thinking sugar
But I just got that feeling sugar
I can hear the sirens burning
Red lights turning
I can't turn back now
So hold on tight

I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby this is getting serious
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Detain the dangerous
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Detain the dangerous

It's dangerous so dangerous
I wanna do it again
Come on baby
It's dangerous so dangerous
I wanna do it again
It's dangerous so dangerous
I wanna do it again

I don't know where the lights are taking us
But something in the night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
Baby, this is getting serious
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Detain the dangerous
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Detain the dangerous
