(Rosetta.
Who are you talking about?
Sweet Loretta Fart. She thought she was a cleaner
Sweet Rosetta Martin
But she was a frying pan, yeah
Rosetta
The picker! The picker! Picture the fingers burning!
Oo-wee!
OK?
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)

Jo Jo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jo Jo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back Jo Jo
Go home

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jo

Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Oh, get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Loretta

Go home
Oh, get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Get back
Woo...

(Thanks, Mo!
I'd like to say "thank you" on behalf of the group
And ourselves and I hope we passed the audition!)
