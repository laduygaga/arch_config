[Alexander:]
What in the hell was that?
What in the hell are you doing downtown?
Don't you know that Burr is going to run against your father to humiliate me and try to bring us down?
I will not let our family be embarrassed like this
I'll grab a pen and paper, let the whole world know
You swing at my family you better not miss
You better have another punch to throw

[Eliza:]
You could let it go
Stay alive for me
Let it go
Live to fight another day
People will always be critical
They'll make the personal political
They'll try to knock you off your pedestal, your pinnacle
Let other people be cynical
Let it go
You're smiling because you know I'm right

[Alexander:]
Ha!

[Eliza:]
And you know if the president were here he would tell you the same thing

[Alexander:]
No, the president's not here..

[Washington:]
I heard about Burr
You didn't kill him did you?

[Alexander:]
Were you here this whole time?

[Washington:]
Let it go
Stay alive for me

[Washington/Eliza:]
Let it go

[Eliza:]
Let it slide right by

[Washington:]
Let it slide right by

[Eliza:]
You don't have to bring a gun to a knife fight
It's not a case of your money or your life, right?

[Washington:]
You know you really oughta listen to your wife, right?

[Alexander:]
I know

[Eliza:]
So let it go

[Burr:]
Talk less!

[Ensemble:]
Burr!

[Burr:]
Smile more!

[Ensemble:]
Burr!

[Burr:]
Don't let 'em know what you're against or what you're for!

[Ensemble:]
Burr!

[Burr:]
Shake hands with him!

[Ensemble:]
Burr!

[Burr:]
Charm her!

[Ensemble:]
Ladies and gentlemen welcome Senator Aaron Burr!

[Eliza:]
Ooooh

[Washington:]
Let everybody know
You can take a body blow
Let everybody know
You can learn to let it go

[Eliza:]
Look around, look around at how
Lucky you are to be alive right now

[Washington:]
Let everybody know
You can take a body blow
Let everybody know
You can take a body blow
Let everybody know
You can take a body blow
Let everybody know
You can take a body blow

[Eliza:]
Look around, look around at how
Lucky you are to be alive right now
If somebody tries to lay you low

[Eliza/Washington:]
Let it go
