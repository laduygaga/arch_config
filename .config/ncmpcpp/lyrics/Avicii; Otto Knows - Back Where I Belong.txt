Step off the chain of dawn
Back in the place where I was born
It's been ten years since I've been gone
It took me ten years to know I'm wrong

I've been everywhere, nothing is new
And I've done everything I've set out to do
I'm nothing without you
Without you I'm nothing at all

I'm back where I belong
No matter where I'm from
It's been here all along
I finally made it home

Don't know the price of time
Until you know what life can buy
You know I hope the world's been kind
Hope you can see it in my eyes

And I've been everywhere, and nothing is new
And I've done everything I've set out to do
I'm nothing without you
Without you I'm nothing at all

I'm back where I belong
No matter where I'm from
It's been here all along
I finally made it home
I finally made it home

I'm back where I belong
No matter where I'm from
It's been here all along
I finally made it home
