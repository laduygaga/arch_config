Mr. President, you asked to see me
I know you're busy
What do you need sir?
Sir?
I wanna give you a word of warning
Sir, I don't know what you heard,
But whatever it is, Jefferson started it
Thomas Jefferson resigned this morning
You're kidding
I need a favor
Whatever you say sir, Jefferson will pay for this behavior
Talk less
I'll use the press,
I'll write under a pseudonym, you'll see what I can do to him
I need you to draft an address
Yes! He resigned, you can finally speak your mind
No. He's stepping down so he can run for President
Ha! Good luck defeating you, sir
I'm stepping down, I'm not running for President
I'm sorry, what?
One last time- relax, have a drink with me
One last time.
Let's take a break tonight, and then we'll teach em how to say goodbye
To say goodbye, you and I
No, sir, why?
I want to talk about neutrality
Sir, with Britain and France on the
Verge of war, is this the best time-
I want to warn against partisan fighting
But-
Pick up a pen start writing
I wanna talk about what I have learned
The hard won wisdom I have earned
As far as the people are concerned, you have to serve
You could continue to serve
No. One last time, the people will hear from me
One last time, and if we get this right
We're gonna teach' em how to say goodbye
You and I
Mr. President- they will say you're weak
No- they will see we're strong
Your position is so unique
So I'll use it to move them along
Why do you have to say goodbye?
If I say goodbye, the nation learns to move on
It outlives me when I'm gone
Like the scripture says,
Everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree
And no one shall make them afraid
They'll be safe in the nation we've made
I want to sit under my own vine and fig tree
A moment alone in the shade
At home, in this nation we've made
One last time
One last time
Though, in reviewing the incidents of my administration
I am unconscious of intentional error.
I am nevertheless too sensible of my
Defects not to think it probable that
I may have committed many errors.
I shall also carry with me the hope that
My country will view them with indulgence;
And that after 45 years of my life
Dedicated to it's service with an upright zeal
The faults of incopetent abilities will
Be consigned to oblivion,
As I myself will soon be- to the mansions of rest.
I anticipate with pleasing expectation
That retreat in which I promised myself to
Realize, the sweet enjoyment of partaking
In the midst of my fellow citizens
The benign influence of good laws and a free government
The ever-favorite object of my heart
And the happy reward, as I trust, of a mutual cares
Of labours, and dangers.
One last time
(George Washington's going home)
We'll teach em how to say goodbye
(George Washington's going home)
You and I
(George Washinton's going home)
Going home
(George Washington's going home)
History has it's eyes on you...
We're gonna teach them how to say goodbye
Teach them how to say goobye
To say goodbye, say goodbye
One Last Time
