2020-05-23 00:13:32	miika25	I thought xz was better
2020-05-23 00:13:35	ggabriel	oh, and for best practice do backup.tar.xz

2020-05-23 00:14:13	ggabriel	so, basically, I use gzip for speed, if I don't need to compress so much

2020-05-23 07:35:44	Kangie	Hey All. emerge --depclean on a machine that I just setup wants to remove a ton of dependencies. Obviously they're not in the world file, but I'm confused as to why. Stuff like xfce4-screensaver doesn't come with xfce-meta, so I would have had to install that manually.
2020-05-23 07:35:59	Kangie	but I wouldn't install xfce4 screensaver as oneshot, so it should be in the world file.

2020-05-23 07:43:46	Kangie	Ah well. It looks like a whole bunch of ruby stuff is most of the issue.
2020-05-23 07:44:07	Kangie	I'll either add them to the world file or depclean and then install the packages properly.
2020-05-23 07:44:15	+kurly	could be that it was a dependency at some point but is no longer
2020-05-23 07:44:36	Kangie	Yeah. I'll see how I go. Got a spare linux laptop and a liveUSB here, so I doubt I can break the system too badly.
2020-05-23 07:44:39	Kangie	Cheers fellas.
2020-05-23 07:44:44	+kurly	many of the ruby packages are very small
2020-05-23 07:44:59	+kurly	so it looks like a mess when they hit depclean, but maybe not as big a deal as it seems
2020-05-23 07:45:36	+kurly	Kangie: there is also unmerge-backup for FEATURES
2020-05-23 07:46:00	Kangie	Yeah, there's a whole bunch of gst-plugins as well
2020-05-23 07:46:03	Kangie	kurly, I'll look into it.
2020-05-23 07:46:04	+kurly	Kangie: see the description in 'man make.conf' ... it will create quickpkg during depclean, in case you change your mind, it is very fast to reinstall (using -k or -K for example)
2020-05-23 07:46:40	Kangie	It's only 65 packages, tbh. I wonder if my use flags changed...
2020-05-23 07:46:42	Melchior	oh; if only I had known that -"unmerge backup"...
2020-05-23 07:46:43	Kangie	Ah well. I'll sort it out!

2020-05-23 07:48:15	Kangie	kurly, looks useful. If I already have the buildpkg feature enabled, will those packages be cleaned by depclean?
2020-05-23 07:48:38	+kurly	has no effect on depclean
2020-05-23 07:49:11	Kangie	OK, so in theory I should already have packages for those anyway. :)
2020-05-23 07:49:11	Kangie	Thanks mate.
2020-05-23 07:49:11	+kurly	the binpkgs will remain, unless you clean them with eclean-pkg or equivalent
