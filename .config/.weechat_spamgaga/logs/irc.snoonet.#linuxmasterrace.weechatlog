2020-05-23 01:13:25	%SBL	Also I didn't realize the interrogation made reference to TW2 lmao
2020-05-23 01:13:33	%SBL	I barely played that one
2020-05-23 01:13:34	+Asmodean	There's stuff mean spirited people could spoil right now based on your progress in the game. I won't elaborate further.
2020-05-23 01:13:38	%SBL	Ah
2020-05-23 01:13:39	%SBL	I c I c
2020-05-23 01:13:58	%SBL	At least I looked up what I did afterwards
2020-05-23 01:14:07	%SBL	Seems I chose the options I would've wanted to
2020-05-23 01:14:27	+Asmodean	Now I kinda wanna replay it. It's been a while. Maybe choose different options.
2020-05-23 01:14:28	%SBL	Damn devs trynna trick me
2020-05-23 01:15:31	%SBL	Asmodean: the horse can't die can it
2020-05-23 01:16:49	+Asmodean	Roach? He can get on roofs though
2020-05-23 01:17:00	+Asmodean	Also spawn magically whenever you whistle
2020-05-23 01:17:03	+Asmodean	It's a special horse
2020-05-23 01:17:11	%SBL	lmao how does it spawn on a roof
2020-05-23 01:17:26	+Asmodean	It's a meme, there even is a Gwent card for it.
2020-05-23 01:17:32	%SBL	lol
2020-05-23 01:17:32	+Asmodean	Sometimes when you whistle, it spawns on a roof
2020-05-23 01:17:43	+Asmodean	Maybe they fixed it
2020-05-23 01:18:19	%SBL	I'm surprised the aquamen can be really passive sometimes
2020-05-23 01:18:31	%SBL	Just step back a bit and they'll go back to minding their own business
2020-05-23 01:20:15	%SBL	Also you know what I don't get

2020-05-23 01:20:29	%SBL	And I unsheathed to kill em

2020-05-23 01:20:36	%SBL	Wat
2020-05-23 01:21:37	+Asmodean	Btw Quen is the best
2020-05-23 01:21:49	%SBL	Which one is Quen
2020-05-23 01:21:51	%SBL	I forget
2020-05-23 01:21:54	+Asmodean	Shield
2020-05-23 01:21:58	%SBL	Ahhh
2020-05-23 01:22:07	+Asmodean	Also read the beastiery before encounters with new creatures
2020-05-23 01:22:12	%SBL	I don't get why it lists bears as vulnerable to it
2020-05-23 01:22:15	%SBL	Like
2020-05-23 01:22:20	%SBL	How can you be vulnerable to a shield
2020-05-23 01:22:23	+Asmodean	Really beneficial to show their weaknesses
2020-05-23 01:22:35	%SBL	Asmodean: but stuff shows in the beastiary only AFTER I kill it
2020-05-23 01:22:37	+Asmodean	No it means they rely on brute force, and quen shields you from that, rendering their strength useless
2020-05-23 01:22:45	%SBL	Idk
2020-05-23 01:22:50	%SBL	I didn't find the bear that hard
2020-05-23 01:22:55	%SBL	And it was +4 lvls
2020-05-23 01:22:58	+Asmodean	SBL: oh that's true
2020-05-23 01:23:03	%SBL	I have a harder time with packs of ghoul
2020-05-23 01:23:04	%SBL	s
2020-05-23 01:23:14	+Asmodean	But in general, that's what it means if a creature is weak to stuff like quen.
2020-05-23 01:23:18	%SBL	Ah yea
2020-05-23 01:23:23	%SBL	I c now
2020-05-23 01:23:28	+Asmodean	The other is poisons with which you coat your weapons and stuff
2020-05-23 01:23:33	+Asmodean	Or bomb
2020-05-23 01:23:34	+Asmodean	s
2020-05-23 01:23:36	%SBL	Can you use ranged weapons when using the shield?
2020-05-23 01:23:42	%SBL	I noticed the sword doesn't work
2020-05-23 01:23:56	@R0flcopt3r	SBL: waddap
2020-05-23 01:24:00	+Asmodean	The basic shield is a one time spell cast which is then up until it is depleted. You can do anything during that time.

2020-05-23 01:24:33	%SBL	Asmodean: no but like when they shield was active, I couldn't hurt the enemies with the sword
2020-05-23 01:24:44	+Asmodean	Ohh yeah
2020-05-23 01:24:45	%SBL	Or maybe they just evaded perfectly idk

2020-05-23 02:39:44	cheers	the autocomplete usually suggests the correct directory inline
2020-05-23 02:39:51	cheers	and i can accept part of/all of it

2020-05-23 02:50:08	@R0flcopt3r	was waiting for dns shit
2020-05-23 02:50:20	@R0flcopt3r	so I just made a until look that tries to nslookup, whenever nslookup fails, it sleepds

2020-05-23 02:50:54	@R0flcopt3r	when the website was up, I got notified
2020-05-23 02:51:02	+cheers	since it syntax highlights and indents your script as you write it
2020-05-23 02:51:06	@R0flcopt3r	rather, when the dns shit was updated
2020-05-23 02:51:12	+cheers	and gives you useful editing
2020-05-23 02:51:15	@R0flcopt3r	cheers: ye, that's kinda neat
2020-05-23 02:51:21	@R0flcopt3r	useful editing how?
2020-05-23 02:51:30	@R0flcopt3r	zsh has a bizzare version of readline
2020-05-23 02:51:32	+cheers	like, i can use vi commands and stuff
2020-05-23 02:51:34	@R0flcopt3r	which is sorta annoying
2020-05-23 02:51:37	+cheers	across lines

2020-05-23 02:51:55	@R0flcopt3r	I prefer readline for line editing
2020-05-23 02:52:00	+cheers	though fish's vi emulation kinda sucks
2020-05-23 02:52:13	+cheers	and i've been meaning to file a pr for that for a while
2020-05-23 02:52:16	@R0flcopt3r	mostly because I've had very little suckess with the vi emulation in various shells
2020-05-23 02:52:31	@R0flcopt3r	the only shell that is able to properly emulate vim stuff is ironically eshell
2020-05-23 02:52:46	@R0flcopt3r	which is emacs shell
2020-05-23 02:53:02	@R0flcopt3r	but eshell is some strange lisp/posix hybrid thing
2020-05-23 02:53:04	@R0flcopt3r	that's pretty confusing
2020-05-23 02:53:13	+cheers	pretty sure fish just uses readline under the hood
2020-05-23 02:53:17	@R0flcopt3r	prob
2020-05-23 02:53:23	@R0flcopt3r	zsh doesn't
2020-05-23 02:53:24	+cheers	like, you can bind readline commands to keys n stuff
2020-05-23 02:53:58	+cheers	or rather, readline functions exposed as builtins
