2019-12-09 04:54:21	sheep	a new kind of connector
2019-12-09 04:54:26	whislock	eXeC64: It's just a different method of generating an interface address as part of the SLAAC process.
2019-12-09 04:54:31	daria	not compatible with sata molex?
2019-12-09 04:54:39	grawity	daria: photo?
2019-12-09 04:54:48	daria	img is included

2019-12-09 04:55:04	daria	anyway i got to get one of those boxy looking ones then
2019-12-09 04:55:09	daria	with standard connectors?
2019-12-09 04:55:10	grawity	yeah that's M.2 and no it is not compatible with sata molex
2019-12-09 04:55:14	daria	ah
2019-12-09 04:55:22	daria	im limited to sata molex, ssd still an option rite?
2019-12-09 04:55:36	grawity	the more expensive M.2 SSDs aren't even SATA, they're PCIe (the M.2 port can carry both)
2019-12-09 04:55:47	daria	i see
2019-12-09 04:55:52	grawity	yeah I guess you're limited to usual 2.5" inch SATA SSDs
2019-12-09 04:55:57	grawity	but there's still plenty of those as well
2019-12-09 04:55:59	daria	okay thanks
2019-12-09 04:56:03	daria	those seem pricier tho
2019-12-09 04:56:30	grawity	hmm I thought usually M.2 ones are pricier
2019-12-09 04:56:37	daria	not in here

2019-12-09 04:56:51	eXeC64	Seems I've got addr_gen_mode=1 in sysctl. I don't understand how "1: do no generate a link-local address, use EUI64 for addresses generated from autoconf" is different from "0: generate address based on EUI64" Strange phrasing. The behaviour I see sounds much more like "2: generate stable privacy address, RFC7217"
2019-12-09 04:56:58	daria	i could probably fit one of those into a pci-e slot however not on a laptop

2019-12-09 04:58:38	grawity	maybe it's just supply/demand
2019-12-09 04:59:06	daria	well im planning to upgrade a few i3 based notebooks from around 2012
2019-12-09 04:59:13	grawity	like, I'm guessing "860 EVO" SATA M.2 is cheaper than its 2.5" variant because who the fuck wants to buy it if they can get a NVMe M.2 one instead?
2019-12-09 04:59:47	grawity	tbh, it is still standard SATA, so I wonder if there are adapters from M.2 to traditional SATA cabling
2019-12-09 05:00:01	daria	i would buy that

2019-12-09 05:00:39	grawity	I mean why not, it's very few components
2019-12-09 05:00:43	daria	more delivery costs tho so i should stick to sata connector ssd
2019-12-09 05:00:47	grawity	just like the NVMe M.2 to full-size PCIe adapters
2019-12-09 05:00:59	grawity	yeah I don't think you will save much in the end

2019-12-17 02:30:24	ldiamond	I had hardware issues while runnign `pacman -Syu` which is causing a corrupted system. It won't boot now since it's missing vmlinuz and such. I'm trying to reinstall `linux` but it complains that it's missing from /var/lib/pacman/local/...
2019-12-17 02:30:35	ldiamond	I tried to run `pacman -Scc`, there's still the same issue
2019-12-17 02:30:51	ldiamond	How can I get pacman to just refetch it and reinstall it

2019-12-17 03:30:40	ldiamond	yep
2019-12-17 03:30:41	teraflops	get a list and pipe it to pacman
2019-12-17 03:30:42	ldiamond	That's what fails

2019-12-17 03:32:03	Foxboron	Yes. man pacman and look at --overwrite
2019-12-17 03:32:16	ldiamond	but is that really a good idea?
2019-12-17 03:32:23	teraflops	something like pacman --asdeps -S $(<pacman -Qqdn)

2020-05-23 00:16:16	mplavsic	hello everyone. I don't know what i did, but i can no longer minimize applications on Arch Linux. The checkbox "show qbittorrent in notification area" is set to false and disabled: it is not possible to set it to true. Similarly, Telegram doesn't even show the notification area settings (they used to be presentin the app settings, and they are still present to a friend of mine who uses Fedora). And even on apps where you can set it (such as Discord
2020-05-23 00:16:18	mplavsic	or Teams). I do not see the app in the notification area (I am using KStatusNotifierItem)

2020-05-23 03:03:33	NetSysFire	and also, if this is your very first installation, try it in a vm first, so you wont brick anything by accident

2020-05-23 03:04:30	NetSysFire	we are just telling you to read the documentation, arch means that you got to do this
2020-05-23 03:04:31	Namarrgon	if you can't make sense of the fdisk output then you have some catching-up to do

2020-05-23 06:02:24	BrainDamage	use -j $(nproc) if you want it to use automatically all cores
2020-05-23 06:02:37	dreisner	i mean, ninja doesn't make you ask to use all cores...
2020-05-23 06:02:43	Dan39	eschwartz: you are running makepkg yourself usually, right? so you woud know if thats the case haha, and shut that off i guess. but sure, i wasn't saying it SHOULD i was just saying i'm surprised it doesn't. maybe that is a good reason it doesn't and therefore me being surprised is just me being ignorant :P
2020-05-23 06:02:51	BrainDamage	what's really insane is that -j without an argument tries to spawn processes until it cannot anymore
2020-05-23 06:03:03	BrainDamage	which often results in the system dying on you
2020-05-23 06:03:34	eschwartz	Dan39: makepkg and make are not the same thing at all
2020-05-23 06:03:41	eschwartz	make, does not default to all cores
2020-05-23 06:03:51	Shipp	b1ack0p: I do arch/windows. You should shrink your windows partition inside of windows first to create free space, then use that space to install arch
2020-05-23 06:03:53	eschwartz	our vendor makepkg.conf, does not override the default Make options
2020-05-23 06:03:53	Dan39	right, i know that haha
2020-05-23 06:04:02	Shipp	linux is pretty meh with ntfs so resizing it inside linux can break your windows partition.
2020-05-23 06:04:09	BrainDamage	well, makepkg does set some cflags by default
2020-05-23 06:04:12	eschwartz	ninja does default to all cores, and we don't override that default either
2020-05-23 06:04:20	BrainDamage	setting make flags bby default would not be a big step further
2020-05-23 06:04:32	eschwartz	cflags and makeflags are quite different
2020-05-23 06:04:47	BrainDamage	I know, one is read by the compiler and the other by the buildsystem
2020-05-23 06:04:54	dreisner	it wouldn't be terrible if we set it to something like -j$(nproc)  but assuming anything else isn't fair.
2020-05-23 06:04:58	eschwartz	cflags are being set because that's how we expect binaries to be built by default, makeflags doesn't change artifact output

2020-05-23 08:27:40	mirk0	i'm using optimus manager, it's pretty simple to use. If it suits to your case try it.
