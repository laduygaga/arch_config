2019-12-08 06:52:37	fizzie	Wee-ell. That really depends on what you're doing. I imagine most of the time when you care about days, you also care about local time. But that's super-inconvenient for calculating durations, because then not all days are of the same length.

2019-12-08 06:55:28	fizzie	An opaque "instant" (which is what time_t is) plus a bunch of conversion functions to go to/from instants and broken-down calendar times (with time zones) is a pretty reasonable time API.
2019-12-08 06:56:13	dave0	fizzie: i imagine it would be easier for the computer to say "yesterday" or "tomorrow" or "last monday" if you have the number of days

2019-12-08 06:57:16	fizzie	Not that the API choice can do much about the sort of edge cases like that.
2019-12-08 06:57:50	fizzie	Well, okay, "yesterday" probably has a definition, I meant to ask about "one day ago".

2019-12-08 07:02:51	fizzie	As far as C's time API is concerned, the closest it gets to that sort of calculations is that mktime accepts values that are outside the normal ranges, so you can just subtract one from tm_mday and call mktime on it, to get to "yesterday". (Though I'm not sure what it does for DST discontinuity.)

2019-12-09 00:01:14	Love4Boobies	Well, if you don't want to tie yourself to UNIX systems, then use C threading.
2019-12-09 00:01:17	Love4Boobies	Seems pretty obvious.
2019-12-09 00:01:37	c_nix	it  is oart of POSIX, but C - that would require checking plus not make too much sense

2019-12-09 00:02:04	Love4Boobies	Then use whichever one you like.

2019-12-09 00:30:35	artsi0m	And maybe a little bit stupid question on style. As i can see its better to use braces rather than just identation ?
2019-12-09 00:31:30	Love4Boobies	Could be useful in case you want to add some more stuff later on and don't see the missing braces.
2019-12-09 00:31:50	Love4Boobies	So you might expect to be adding something to a compound statement when you're actually not.
2019-12-09 00:32:28	apep11	Love4Boobies: Ahah. So if we create a non-detaching thread and when we join it, the resources return to us, while if we create a detaching thread and detach it, we don't get resources back because they are released.
2019-12-09 00:32:31	apep11	Is that correct?

2019-12-09 02:28:17	xuxx	is it a bad habit to write for loop/if/.. without braces if there is only one statement inside ?
2019-12-09 02:28:59	Elladan	No.
2019-12-09 02:31:31	xuxx	Thanks !
2019-12-09 02:32:30	Elladan	In general just follow common sense and/or your project's style guide with that stuff.
2019-12-09 02:33:43	Elladan	Like if the one statement is six lines long, probably use the braces even though they're not necessary.
2019-12-09 02:34:45	xuxx	I prefer to ask instead of taking the risk of writing bad code ^^
2019-12-09 02:35:29	Love4Boobies	xuxx: Some would say that it is. The reason for always using braces being that if someone is editing something in a hurry or using some tool to refactor the code, they might miss that there are no braces.
2019-12-09 02:35:53	Love4Boobies	And instead of a compound statement, they'd only get the first thing in the conditional or loop statement.
2019-12-09 02:36:03	Elladan	Anyone with a decent tool or editor would not have that problem.

2019-12-09 02:37:38	Elladan	There are a lot of rules people put in style guides of that sort of questionable nature. You can't generalize them because reasonable people disagree.
2019-12-09 02:38:05	Elladan	However, you can generalize that you should follow the project's style guide.
2019-12-09 02:38:19	Elladan	And yes, you can police your contributors.
2019-12-09 02:38:37	Love4Boobies	You can but it takes extra effort and even then things can escape.

2019-12-09 02:41:05	Elladan	You can... not... detach them.
2019-12-09 02:41:15	Love4Boobies	That is usually the right course.
2019-12-09 02:41:18	apep11	I need as many thread running concurrently.
2019-12-09 02:42:18	apep11	I guess I can just call abort() with errno... but I won't be able to free memory then...
2019-12-09 02:42:35	Elladan	apep11, when you detach the threads, you're leaving yourself open to annoying issues of just this sort.
2019-12-09 02:42:37	apep11	Actually exit() not abort()
2019-12-09 02:42:43	Love4Boobies	By the way, you've mentioned earlier something about adding threads to improve performance and you know say you're trying to run as many as possible. Out of curiosity, may I ask what you are doing with them to improve performance?
2019-12-09 02:42:50	Elladan	According to my documentation exit() is MT-unsafe.

2019-12-09 02:44:25	Elladan	apep11, if you join your threads, then your process can exit in an orderly manner the same as when it started, with no threads running in the background and possibly failing.
2019-12-09 02:44:48	twkm	apep11: i hope you aren't under the impression that the number of threads is limited when joinable but less so when detached.
2019-12-09 02:45:03	apep11	Love4Boobies: I have a parser where parsing is done in two phases. After the first phase "major" nodes are produced, and some major nodes can have up to two "minor" nodes that need further parsing. I want to parse all minor nodes concurrently instead of just going node by node.
2019-12-09 02:45:15	Elladan	apep11, with detached threads, you have the potential problem that the threads are doing things while you're shutting down the process, which means it's easy to reach a state where they crash in the middle of exit() because you freed memory or something.
2019-12-09 02:45:50	Love4Boobies	It sounds like you're actually degrading performance to me.
2019-12-09 02:46:02	apep11	Love4Boobies: Why?
2019-12-09 02:46:36	Elladan	Regardless of whether your threads increase or decrease performance, you should learn to use them in a way which is safe.
2019-12-09 02:46:36	apep11	Actually I think I can do it with thrd_join.
2019-12-09 02:46:47	apep11	Elladan: I'm trying.
2019-12-09 02:47:16	Elladan	apep11, you can easily pass back the error code as the return value in join then.
2019-12-09 02:48:14	Love4Boobies	Because unless you're running this on some super crazy machine with a bajillion cores, your threads are creating a lot of overhead. Most systems have limited resources.
2019-12-09 02:48:31	apep11	Elladan: Ok, do I just return errno; from the function associated with the thread id, or do I use thrd_exit?
2019-12-09 02:48:44	Love4Boobies	I don't think "as many threads as possible" is a good way to go, necessarily.
2019-12-09 02:48:50	apep11	Love4Boobies: I thought about that, I hoped someone would mention it.
2019-12-09 02:49:17	Love4Boobies	It's not like some type of magic that just because things are concurrent they will also be faster.

2019-12-09 02:50:54	Elladan	apep11, as a general side note, you should usually collect errno into a local variable immediately after any failure.
2019-12-09 02:50:55	apep11	So maybe the best thing is to concurrently pass those two nodes of major node?
2019-12-09 02:51:07	Love4Boobies	Weird. I've never seen a language specification like that. At any rate, maybe I just don't know enough about your problem domain.

2019-12-09 02:51:39	Elladan	apep11, the reason is that you might call other functions after the error (e.g. a logging function or similar) which clears the errno.
2019-12-09 02:51:40	apep11	Love4Boobies: Idk it's my first parser :).
2019-12-09 02:51:57	apep11	Actually not I had one before it but it was simple.
2019-12-09 02:54:16	apep11	Elladan: I understand, that's what I usually do, but since this is a library I don't have any logging functions here. Maybe that's not good but whatever maybe in future versions.
2019-12-09 02:55:10	Elladan	apep11, it's just good practice, in case e.g. you put some logging functions in as part of debugging in the future.

2019-12-09 03:12:48	apep11	I also have some global variables used by all of code. How to make them thread safe as errno? They don't need to be reported to the external program, just to be used within the thread.
2019-12-09 03:13:04	apep11	Or I can use mutexes but maybe this is easier.
2019-12-09 03:13:40	Elladan	In general, do not use globals or thread local storage.
2019-12-09 03:13:49	Elladan	When you need shared state, use a mutex.
2019-12-09 03:14:24	apep11	Ok then.
2019-12-09 03:14:55	Elladan	If you're worried that using a mutex on your shared state will make your program slow, consider why you have shared state and whether threads are appropriate.
2019-12-09 03:16:58	apep11	Well now I'm just using threads for concurrently parsing two minor nodes of each major node, while major nodes are parsed sequentially.
2019-12-09 03:17:14	apep11	So I think it's ok, as long as threads don't take too much too start?

2019-12-09 03:19:09	Elladan	My guess is that since you're writing a "parser", the work done on each node is trivial, and also, the threads are all sharing the lexer. So my guess is that threads will make your program slower.

2019-12-09 04:33:13	Love4Boobies	If you want something "like scanf and printf" then you're talking about synchronous I/O, in which case you want to have multiple blocking threads. If you're not, you want asynchronous handling and a single event loop.

2019-12-09 17:28:00	uso_	but compiler are better at optimising int... (because it's UB on overflow)
2019-12-09 17:28:14	saku	so yes, I get that if size_t is actually only of int or char length, you'd have more efficient code; but suppose I don't care about the extra cycles needed to process the larger types; is there a situation in which size_t would continue to work
2019-12-09 17:28:21	uso_	d3x0r: why would size_t be faster ?
2019-12-09 17:28:40	d3x0r	well... I made this virtual disk library; it used size_t.  On 32 bit platforms, I couldn't create disks > 4GB... ended up using a larger type 'uint64_t' as an option for smaller platforms to work with larger platform disks
2019-12-09 17:28:44	saku	uso_, that's a non-issue right, if the amount of memory is enough to fit in an int, size_t will probably be an int
2019-12-09 17:28:54	d3x0r	size_t will probably NOT be an int.
2019-12-09 17:29:02	uso_	saku:no size_t have to be unsigned
2019-12-09 17:29:13	saku	oops I meant unsigned int
2019-12-09 17:29:25	d3x0r	and even then 64 bit platforms it's never an int
2019-12-09 17:29:42	uso_	saku:int are faster then unsigned int
2019-12-09 17:29:58	saku	true, but if it's not correct, fast is not worth it

2019-12-09 17:30:27	saku	2^32 = 4 Gigs right
2019-12-09 17:30:37	saku	so if I have an object larger than 4gigs in size
2019-12-09 17:30:49	saku	an int of 32bits won't be able to hold it
2019-12-09 17:30:52	uso_	saku: well ok, on linux long are 32 bit on 32bit CPU and 64 bit on 64 bit CPU, but on windows they always are 32 bit
2019-12-09 17:31:12	uso_	long long are 64 bit on 32 bit so slower
2019-12-09 17:31:19	saku	the problem remains in principle though
2019-12-09 17:31:23	uso_	here's your answer
2019-12-09 17:31:41	saku	If I have over 64 bits of RAM size
2019-12-09 17:31:49	d3x0r	you won't...
2019-12-09 17:31:50	saku	will size_t continue to work?
2019-12-09 17:31:54	d3x0r	yes
2019-12-09 17:32:09	saku	... but long wont
2019-12-09 17:32:21	d3x0r	long could still be 32 bit
2019-12-09 17:32:28	d3x0r	uint64_t
2019-12-09 17:32:30	saku	yes
2019-12-09 17:32:48	uso_	d3x0r: but could size_t be smaller then a long too ?
2019-12-09 17:33:01	d3x0r	yes on a 16 bit platform
2019-12-09 17:33:07	saku	so, contractually, the compiler will have to come up with ways for dealing with the obscenely large size_t
2019-12-09 17:33:09	saku	not me
2019-12-09 17:33:18	d3x0r	yes
2019-12-09 17:33:41	saku	so if I do sizeof(foo) < (size_t) sizeof(bar)
2019-12-09 17:33:49	d3x0r	no
2019-12-09 17:33:52	saku	that should work every time on every platform
2019-12-09 17:34:01	d3x0r	ya but (size_t)(size_t) is redundant
2019-12-09 17:34:03	saku	??
2019-12-09 17:34:09	saku	oops
2019-12-09 17:34:21	saku	I was originally going to type (size_t) bar
2019-12-09 17:34:28	d3x0r	ya
2019-12-09 17:34:46	uso_	d3x0r: I don't think the standard said size_t have to be the size of a pointer
2019-12-09 17:34:53	uso_	in practice it is
2019-12-09 17:36:01	saku	thanks, it think it's more clear now
2019-12-09 17:36:03	d3x0r	it couldn't do a very good job of tracking object sizes if it wasn't as big as the pointer (minus a couple bits)
2019-12-09 17:36:06	d3x0r	but not half of them
2019-12-09 17:36:44	uso_	sure but it's still implementation define

2019-12-09 22:21:41	AMDG	Anyways, I finish this mm, and then I'm directly on to making the pattern language parser as input to the algorithm. I still need to refactor the compiler to utilize symbol_context, though I'm probably going to name it something else like symbol_buffer. It exists so that I don't have to walk the whole symbol tree just to get the concrete symbols.

2019-12-09 22:23:29	AMDG	The pattern generated from a given textual pattern input creates a symbol node tree which is effectively a dictionary. mdu_match_symbol_subset is then called on some input and uses a continuity predicate that checks whether the current symbol is a valid continuation of the current linear sequence of symbols.

2019-12-09 22:24:14	AMDG	In this unoptimized version, you call mdu_match_symbol_subset until there are no more subsets to match the input against. It is by nature a recursive algorithm.
2019-12-09 22:24:53	AMDG	Don't ask me what kind of parser it is because I wouldn't know the first thing about types of parsers.

2019-12-09 22:40:59	kurahaupo	So if God is the first author and therefore a copyright holder, how does one apply for a licence to use the work? How does anyone else get to receive delegated authority to grant such licences?

After reading #6 I legit think he's a troll playing the long-game
2019-12-09 22:43:15	AMDG	I am just echoing the words of Holy Mother Church that God is, formally, the efficient cause of all things. He also gave all of the things in the material universe to us, so there is no need to ask for permission when it is ours.
2019-12-09 22:43:31	ornxka	kurahaupo: that is a matter of great contension
2019-12-09 22:44:27	AMDG	But it would seem the ##C is becoming severely off topic. I'm still trying to figure out why these values as a result of casting or otherwise somehow modified are 0xbaadf00dbaadf00d
2019-12-09 22:44:40	ornxka	that is very odd
2019-12-09 22:44:53	ornxka	casting a pointer to uintptr_t should never modify the value of it
2019-12-09 22:45:02	AMDG	exactly
2019-12-09 22:45:06	ornxka	AMDG: do you do any kind of uh

2019-12-09 22:45:35	AMDG	Nope. Just simple pointer arithmetic. It is very possibly quite likely there is some UB here causing this.
2019-12-09 22:45:42	ornxka	hmmmm
2019-12-09 22:47:19	AMDG	I'm going to try just changing everything to void *, and if that doesn't work, then I know it is something else.

2019-12-09 23:00:26	AMDG	m_heap_create calls malloc for the struct heap and then calloc for heap->memory. A call to m_get should be to memory that has been allocated with calloc as it is an offset of heap->memory.

2019-12-09 23:03:39	AMDG	Those functions are not relevant to this. It is assumed data is already initialized as those set functions work with blocks initialized with m_get. m_setv/m_setvd work on foreign memory blocks.

2019-12-17 01:49:20	Kaslai	I'd say my rule of thumb is: if there's any room for confusion, use better names
2019-12-17 01:49:35	EdFletcherT137	I don't know the context of that variable, the function it's in nor the code base as a whole. I cannot answer that. I'm not sure you're quite getting this.
2019-12-17 01:49:59	johnjay	i'm asking if making a definition then immediately using it would be sufficient context for your rule
2019-12-17 01:49:59	LKoen	johnjay: why do you have to store that string in your variable w? can't you use the string directly?
