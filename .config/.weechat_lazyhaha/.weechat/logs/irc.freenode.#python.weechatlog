2019-12-08 20:37:40	[Tritium]	If you use a model, philisophical questions go away, and you can just build the code to return what you need to consume

2019-12-08 20:39:23	locsmif	The if checks, the behaviour of what would be displayed, etc. etc.
2019-12-08 20:40:01	locsmif	From is None to == '' .. I don't want "None" displayed in table cells. So what do you mean it doesn't matter?
2019-12-08 20:40:45	locsmif	A string conversion of None is 'None' as well, so
2019-12-08 20:40:50	[Tritium]	the entire point of using the model is you can disconnect what the display portion needs, datastructure wise, to what the rest of your code cares about.  Don't bother caring about the internals of the model, just return a datastructure the rest of your code can use.  It doesn't matter what your internal representation is.

2019-12-09 00:43:47	ce6	altendky so the + 1 is where we are using it and the statement removing a coin from the list is losing it?
2019-12-09 00:44:47	InPhase	ce6: Looks like you're using a reuse-it-or-lose-it algorithm.  Which is fine, that works for your problem.  handy is the reuse it case, handy2 is the lose it case, because the coin is lost from the list of possible coins.  However you have a second deviation because of your stop-reusing case under if, where you only lose it and don't reuse it.

2019-12-09 03:23:42	IaMnEwHeRe	dualinity, 2 things regarding your project, since you asked for feedback(which will go off topic rather quickly), the query-language-thing will mean only programmers will use it and regarding freeing your data, it is a misconception, the data is still within google and Facebook and co
2019-12-09 03:23:54	IaMnEwHeRe	for your data to be free you need to actually run your own infrastructure
2019-12-09 03:23:55	Soni	nedbat: I'd expect a function that "yields" (as per docs) would produce iterators, not arbitrary iterables

2019-12-09 03:25:19	InPhase	dualinity: Yeah, I'd agree that it doesn't free the data, and the insights aren't unlimited.  But it does put your aggregated data into your own hands, for your own purposes, and can provide deep insights and analyses for your own benefit rather than just those of others.
2019-12-09 03:25:40	dualinity	the unlimited part is about that most people doing quantified self go about doing a single analysis of 1 source
2019-12-09 03:25:44	InPhase	dualinity: So it sounds valuable.  Just state better the things it actually does for you.  :)
2019-12-09 03:25:48	dualinity	the idea here is that it becomes possible to do cross-source analysis
2019-12-09 03:26:00	energizer	dualinity: i'd consider activitywatch as a source

2019-12-09 03:26:35	InPhase	dualinity: Well it's going to be intrinsically limited to what exists in the source data, so it's definitely not unlimited.  :)
2019-12-09 03:26:54	InPhase	dualinity: But deep, yes.
2019-12-09 03:27:05	dualinity	yea... practically unlimited though

2019-12-09 14:46:36	ammar2	the dict.pop(key) is just an in place operation that will remove the key from the dict and return its value

2019-12-09 14:47:17	riiski	ammar2: but why?
2019-12-09 14:47:36	ammar2	why what?
2019-12-09 14:47:50	ammar2	why is it popping? why is not passing max_hours up to the super class?
2019-12-09 14:47:50	riiski	Why is it needed?
2019-12-09 14:47:57	riiski	yes
2019-12-09 14:48:15	ammar2	because they don't want to propagate the argument up. This depends on what this class's parent is

2019-12-09 22:05:01	Trieste	Yhg1s: right, thanks! one more thing, though - what if I don't know the wait time beforehand? (i.e. it's some kind of a long blocking wait) - should I just use threading along with asyncio then?

2019-12-09 22:05:33	Yhg1s	Jordy: you got your parentheses wrong. you need range(1, len(seq2) + 1), not range(1, len(seq2)) + 1
