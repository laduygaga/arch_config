2020-05-23 01:13:25	%SBL	Also I didn't realize the interrogation made reference to TW2 lmao
2020-05-23 01:13:33	%SBL	I barely played that one
2020-05-23 01:13:34	+Asmodean	There's stuff mean spirited people could spoil right now based on your progress in the game. I won't elaborate further.
2020-05-23 01:13:38	%SBL	Ah
2020-05-23 01:13:39	%SBL	I c I c
2020-05-23 01:13:58	%SBL	At least I looked up what I did afterwards
2020-05-23 01:14:07	%SBL	Seems I chose the options I would've wanted to
2020-05-23 01:14:27	+Asmodean	Now I kinda wanna replay it. It's been a while. Maybe choose different options.
2020-05-23 01:14:28	%SBL	Damn devs trynna trick me
2020-05-23 01:15:31	%SBL	Asmodean: the horse can't die can it
2020-05-23 01:16:49	+Asmodean	Roach? He can get on roofs though
2020-05-23 01:17:00	+Asmodean	Also spawn magically whenever you whistle
2020-05-23 01:17:03	+Asmodean	It's a special horse
2020-05-23 01:17:11	%SBL	lmao how does it spawn on a roof
2020-05-23 01:17:26	+Asmodean	It's a meme, there even is a Gwent card for it.
2020-05-23 01:17:32	%SBL	lol
2020-05-23 01:17:32	+Asmodean	Sometimes when you whistle, it spawns on a roof
2020-05-23 01:17:43	+Asmodean	Maybe they fixed it
2020-05-23 01:18:19	%SBL	I'm surprised the aquamen can be really passive sometimes
2020-05-23 01:18:31	%SBL	Just step back a bit and they'll go back to minding their own business
2020-05-23 01:20:15	%SBL	Also you know what I don't get

2020-05-23 01:20:29	%SBL	And I unsheathed to kill em

2020-05-23 01:20:36	%SBL	Wat
2020-05-23 01:21:37	+Asmodean	Btw Quen is the best
2020-05-23 01:21:49	%SBL	Which one is Quen
2020-05-23 01:21:51	%SBL	I forget
2020-05-23 01:21:54	+Asmodean	Shield
2020-05-23 01:21:58	%SBL	Ahhh
2020-05-23 01:22:07	+Asmodean	Also read the beastiery before encounters with new creatures
2020-05-23 01:22:12	%SBL	I don't get why it lists bears as vulnerable to it
2020-05-23 01:22:15	%SBL	Like
2020-05-23 01:22:20	%SBL	How can you be vulnerable to a shield
2020-05-23 01:22:23	+Asmodean	Really beneficial to show their weaknesses
2020-05-23 01:22:35	%SBL	Asmodean: but stuff shows in the beastiary only AFTER I kill it
2020-05-23 01:22:37	+Asmodean	No it means they rely on brute force, and quen shields you from that, rendering their strength useless
2020-05-23 01:22:45	%SBL	Idk
2020-05-23 01:22:50	%SBL	I didn't find the bear that hard
2020-05-23 01:22:55	%SBL	And it was +4 lvls
2020-05-23 01:22:58	+Asmodean	SBL: oh that's true
2020-05-23 01:23:03	%SBL	I have a harder time with packs of ghoul
2020-05-23 01:23:04	%SBL	s
2020-05-23 01:23:14	+Asmodean	But in general, that's what it means if a creature is weak to stuff like quen.
2020-05-23 01:23:18	%SBL	Ah yea
2020-05-23 01:23:23	%SBL	I c now
2020-05-23 01:23:28	+Asmodean	The other is poisons with which you coat your weapons and stuff
2020-05-23 01:23:33	+Asmodean	Or bomb
2020-05-23 01:23:34	+Asmodean	s
2020-05-23 01:23:36	%SBL	Can you use ranged weapons when using the shield?
2020-05-23 01:23:42	%SBL	I noticed the sword doesn't work
2020-05-23 01:23:56	@R0flcopt3r	SBL: waddap
2020-05-23 01:24:00	+Asmodean	The basic shield is a one time spell cast which is then up until it is depleted. You can do anything during that time.

2020-05-23 01:24:33	%SBL	Asmodean: no but like when they shield was active, I couldn't hurt the enemies with the sword
2020-05-23 01:24:44	+Asmodean	Ohh yeah
2020-05-23 01:24:45	%SBL	Or maybe they just evaded perfectly idk

2020-05-23 02:39:44	cheers	the autocomplete usually suggests the correct directory inline

2020-05-23 02:50:08	@R0flcopt3r	was waiting for dns shit
2020-05-23 02:50:20	@R0flcopt3r	so I just made a until look that tries to nslookup, whenever nslookup fails, it sleepds

2020-05-23 02:50:54	@R0flcopt3r	when the website was up, I got notified
2020-05-23 02:51:02	+cheers	since it syntax highlights and indents your script as you write it
2020-05-23 02:51:06	@R0flcopt3r	rather, when the dns shit was updated
2020-05-23 02:51:12	+cheers	and gives you useful editing
2020-05-23 02:51:15	@R0flcopt3r	cheers: ye, that's kinda neat
2020-05-23 02:51:21	@R0flcopt3r	useful editing how?
2020-05-23 02:51:30	@R0flcopt3r	zsh has a bizzare version of readline
2020-05-23 02:51:32	+cheers	like, i can use vi commands and stuff
2020-05-23 02:51:34	@R0flcopt3r	which is sorta annoying
2020-05-23 02:51:37	+cheers	across lines

2020-05-23 02:51:55	@R0flcopt3r	I prefer readline for line editing
2020-05-23 02:52:00	+cheers	though fish's vi emulation kinda sucks
2020-05-23 02:52:13	+cheers	and i've been meaning to file a pr for that for a while
2020-05-23 02:52:16	@R0flcopt3r	mostly because I've had very little suckess with the vi emulation in various shells
2020-05-23 02:52:31	@R0flcopt3r	the only shell that is able to properly emulate vim stuff is ironically eshell
2020-05-23 02:52:46	@R0flcopt3r	which is emacs shell
2020-05-23 02:53:02	@R0flcopt3r	but eshell is some strange lisp/posix hybrid thing
2020-05-23 02:53:04	@R0flcopt3r	that's pretty confusing
2020-05-23 02:53:13	+cheers	pretty sure fish just uses readline under the hood
2020-05-23 02:53:17	@R0flcopt3r	prob
2020-05-23 02:53:23	@R0flcopt3r	zsh doesn't
2020-05-23 02:53:24	+cheers	like, you can bind readline commands to keys n stuff
2020-05-23 02:53:58	+cheers	or rather, readline functions exposed as builtins

2020-10-06 17:27:02	@shamcopt3r	the fact is that we've lost a shit ton of keys along the way
2020-10-06 17:27:02	@shamcopt3r	like hyper
2020-10-06 17:27:02	@shamcopt3r	and meta
2020-10-06 17:27:02	@shamcopt3r	modern keyboards suck
2020-10-06 17:27:02	Flexyjerkov	Hyper is defined as CTRL these days?
2020-10-06 17:27:02	@shamcopt3r	wot
2020-10-06 17:27:02	Flexyjerkov	Hyper is the fourth (counting Ctrl) and last modifier on the Space cadet keyboard. 
2020-10-06 17:27:02	Flexyjerkov	google search!
2020-10-06 17:27:02	@shamcopt3r	the space cadet has a ctrl key
2020-10-06 17:27:02	Flexyjerkov	just googled the keyboard, damn thats a funky keyboard
2020-10-06 17:27:02	@shamcopt3r	also, never really noticed how big the space bar is
2020-10-06 17:27:02	@shamcopt3r	on that keyboard
2020-10-06 17:27:02	Flexyjerkov	terminal button!
2020-10-06 17:27:02	Flexyjerkov	it actually looks quite robust, you you say a lot of keys lost along the way but the way i see it is theres now more.. especially if you have a 100% keyboard
2020-10-06 17:27:02	Flexyjerkov	i guess keypad is more a "luxury" 
2020-10-06 17:27:02	Flexyjerkov	is the "rub out" key a backspace?
2020-10-06 17:27:02	@shamcopt3r	but they're all useless
2020-10-06 17:27:02	@shamcopt3r	besides, it's just the numpad
2020-10-06 17:27:02	@shamcopt3r	which is essentially just copies of existing keys
2020-10-06 17:27:02	Flexyjerkov	i guess theres pgdn/pgup/end/home/ins/del though 
2020-10-06 17:27:02	Flexyjerkov	and the F keys
2020-10-06 17:27:02	@shamcopt3r	also
2020-10-06 17:27:02	@shamcopt3r	you have to consider that hyper and meta can be combined with any other key
2020-10-06 17:27:02	Flexyjerkov	ye i guess,
2020-10-06 17:27:02	Flexyjerkov	https://churchm.ag/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Japanese-Keyboard-03.jpeg
2020-10-06 17:27:02	Flexyjerkov	that's a hefty keyboard

2020-10-06 22:04:39	@shamcopt3r	I hate `int *var`
2020-10-06 22:04:43	@shamcopt3r	vs `int* var`
2020-10-06 22:04:47	@shamcopt3r	it's a int pointer
2020-10-06 22:04:51	@shamcopt3r	not a int pointer_var
2020-10-06 22:05:42	%aboft	can you actually name a variable const?
2020-10-06 22:05:47	%aboft	is that what thats doing?
2020-10-06 22:06:05	@shamcopt3r	no
2020-10-06 22:06:18	%aboft	explain now
2020-10-06 22:06:23	@shamcopt3r	`const int* const var` means you make a int pointer namned var
2020-10-06 22:06:27	@shamcopt3r	that you can't change in any way
2020-10-06 22:06:32	Flexyjerkov	woopsie
2020-10-06 22:06:39	@shamcopt3r	you can do `var = nullptr` or `*var = 3`
2020-10-06 22:06:41	Flexyjerkov	i installed grub on my laptop without configuring grub
2020-10-06 22:06:45	Flexyjerkov	and rebooted :/
2020-10-06 22:06:45	+Asmodean	The best thing in cpp is the const auto reference iterator
2020-10-06 22:06:51	+Asmodean	Flexyjerkov: What happened
2020-10-06 22:06:56	Flexyjerkov	stuck at grub>
2020-10-06 22:07:08	@shamcopt3r	`const int* const func() const{ return var; }` returns a const int* const, and also can't change this
2020-10-06 22:07:09	Flexyjerkov	managed to make it to rootfs but borked it
2020-10-06 22:07:12	@shamcopt3r	it's member func
2020-10-06 22:07:33	@shamcopt3r	I guess `const int* const func() const { return this.var; }`
2020-10-06 22:07:40	@shamcopt3r	that makes it a bit more clear
2020-10-06 22:07:41	%aboft	fucking weird
2020-10-06 22:07:55	%audron	don't do pointers kids
2020-10-06 22:08:00	%aboft	the other consts can be just omitted tho right
2020-10-06 22:08:05	%aboft	bc thats confusing af
2020-10-06 22:08:28	@shamcopt3r	`std::shared_pointer<int> int_ptr = std::make_shared_ptr<int>(4)`
2020-10-06 22:08:34	@shamcopt3r	ke
2020-10-06 22:08:50	@shamcopt3r	now imagine if that type wasn't just an int
2020-10-06 22:08:51	%aboft	but why not just do `const int* a;`
2020-10-06 22:08:54	@shamcopt3r	but a namespaced struct or class
2020-10-06 22:09:00	+Asmodean	Just use smart pointers lel
2020-10-06 22:09:11	@shamcopt3r	thankfully auto exists now
2020-10-06 22:10:02	%audron	just use rust

2020-10-06 22:10:59	@shamcopt3r	modern cpp is just rust with shitty compiler errors
2020-10-06 22:11:11	@shamcopt3r	well, and less compiler errors

2020-10-06 22:11:48	@shamcopt3r	aa, toothpick

2020-10-06 22:12:05	@shamcopt3r	I thought you wanted me to make a shiv off the toothbrush
2020-10-06 22:12:11	@shamcopt3r	then kill my mates
2020-10-06 22:12:13	@shamcopt3r	then hang myself after

2020-10-06 22:12:34	@shamcopt3r	but I like the initial plan better

2020-10-06 22:13:16	@shamcopt3r	but I notice I spend way too much time looking and just thinking about what I'm writing nowadays

2020-10-06 22:13:32	@shamcopt3r	compared to just write some mumbojumbo that probably doesn't really work

2020-10-06 22:16:33	marquis_andras	the rest are 1/3rd planning, 1/4 unit testing, 1/4 system testing

2020-10-06 22:17:03	%audron	pfff
2020-10-06 22:17:07	%aboft	`void announce() const {` why tf is there a const after the func name
2020-10-06 22:17:20	@shamcopt3r	I told you
2020-10-06 22:17:30	@shamcopt3r	the const makes it so that you can't change things inside the function
2020-10-06 22:17:40	%audron	also i'd really say it's quite less well known
2020-10-06 22:17:44	@shamcopt3r	yeah
2020-10-06 22:17:45	@shamcopt3r	and it's brilliant
2020-10-06 22:17:47	%audron	i mean once you actually do programm a lot
2020-10-06 22:17:49	@shamcopt3r	and should be used all over the place
2020-10-06 22:18:01	%audron	yes
2020-10-06 22:18:04	%audron	but before that
2020-10-06 22:18:04	%audron	and with everybody else
2020-10-06 22:18:12	%aboft	but
2020-10-06 22:18:19	%aboft	this example makes zero sense
2020-10-06 22:18:34	%aboft	its a fucking printf() in the function
2020-10-06 22:18:35	@shamcopt3r	ye
2020-10-06 22:18:37	@shamcopt3r	so it just reads stuff
2020-10-06 22:18:42	%aboft	what is there to fuckign change
2020-10-06 22:18:48	@shamcopt3r	nothing
2020-10-06 22:18:52	%audron	cus it can't
2020-10-06 22:18:53	%aboft	i never understood shit like static, public, private
2020-10-06 22:19:10	%aboft	because how tf can those "change" when the program is running
2020-10-06 22:19:10	%audron	static makes shit be at compile time
2020-10-06 22:19:10	%audron	like
2020-10-06 22:19:43	@shamcopt3r	aboft: int a = 5; a = 6;
2020-10-06 22:19:43	%audron	it's not executed and evaluated at runtime
2020-10-06 22:19:43	@shamcopt3r	I changed a
2020-10-06 22:19:43	%audron	and can't be changed
2020-10-06 22:19:43	marquis_andras	one of the most difficult part of software projects is understanding other peoples code. the more guarantees you can embed into your code, the easier it becomes to reason about. so put `const` everywhere you don't need to mutate data.
2020-10-06 22:19:51	%audron	and public and private is just if it's usable only by you or by outside actors
2020-10-06 22:20:30	@shamcopt3r	aboft: there's is also protected
2020-10-06 22:20:43	@shamcopt3r	and friend

2020-10-20 17:42:01	Flexyjerkov	and i've had them 3 1/2 years?
2020-10-20 17:42:12	cmj	luminance is fine for now

2020-10-20 18:11:51	cmj	it's led man. we got years on these
2020-10-20 18:12:15	cmj	there are youtube videos of dudes tearing these apart

2020-10-20 22:34:56	@Shamendoo	And firebase is gross
2020-10-20 22:35:10	%aboft	ive been under a different opinion
2020-10-20 22:35:18	%aboft	i see a lot of people preferring firebase but I've never used it
2020-10-20 22:36:13	@Shamendoo	It lets you skip setting up a database now, at the mere cost of paying google a bunch of money and giving all your data to google
2020-10-20 22:36:24	%aboft	oh thats all it is?
2020-10-20 22:36:43	%aboft	I thought it was something to easier handle like tokens and shit for "login with google, twitter, fb, etc"
2020-10-20 22:37:05	@Shamendoo	well they do have a few different products under the name I guess
2020-10-20 22:37:15	%aboft	either way I'd rather develop and maintain my own database
2020-10-20 22:37:16	@Shamendoo	But the main one is the database, there's an auth thing as well

2020-10-21 00:22:32	@Shamendoo	If the content isn't in the initial document, it's definitely client rendered
2020-10-21 00:23:22	@Shamendoo	Not black and white of course, often some stuff is client side and some not
2020-10-21 00:24:14	@Shamendoo	The only sure way is to turn off JS and see if it still works

2020-10-21 02:42:37	Flexyjerkov	but the dell goes up to 300 as its too bright at 100%

2020-10-21 03:01:57	%SBL	But the rest are always plugged in and running

2020-10-21 03:02:45	%SBL	Well
2020-10-21 03:02:54	%SBL	The cheap one got 50% more expensive

2020-10-21 03:03:06	%SBL	But the point is I have no monies lol
2020-10-21 03:03:15	@Shamendoo	But if you want to save a few and can afford a 5 one you could always have 2 switches
2020-10-21 03:03:26	%SBL	Das tru
2020-10-21 03:03:56	@Shamendoo	Probably not as efficient ofc

2020-10-21 03:10:40	%aboft	we use trendnet at work
2020-10-21 03:10:43	@Shamendoo	linksys and like tp-link make the cheapest things, sometimes netgear
2020-10-21 03:10:45	%aboft	cheap little 5 port switches
2020-10-21 03:10:48	%aboft	they're not bad

2020-10-21 03:12:38	@Shamendoo	Should be fine with consumer loads
2020-10-21 03:12:47	@Shamendoo	Like including torrents and stuff
2020-10-21 03:13:05	%SBL	Hmm
2020-10-21 03:13:12	%SBL	Also like
2020-10-21 03:13:20	%SBL	Consider on this switch I also run the Jellyfin server
2020-10-21 03:13:23	%SBL	And the DNS server
2020-10-21 03:13:26	%SBL	And the webserver
2020-10-21 03:13:33	@Shamendoo	Actually it should be fine with any load right?
2020-10-21 03:13:34	%SBL	And I use it as a network share too
2020-10-21 03:13:42	@Shamendoo	a switch doesn't do anything fancy really
2020-10-21 03:13:49	%SBL	It switches amirite

2020-10-21 03:26:04	%SBL	Oh wow
2020-10-21 03:26:09	%SBL	I didn't notice it was twice the price lol
2020-10-21 03:26:18	%SBL	Well not twice
2020-10-21 03:26:21	%SBL	Almost twice
2020-10-21 03:27:08	%SBL	Anyways the switch decision depends entirely on how cheap I can get my GPU come Novemeber
2020-10-21 03:28:05	%SBL	rn the EVGA is at a really nice price
2020-10-21 03:28:11	%SBL	I'm just hoping it holds

2020-10-21 04:20:04	Flexyjerkov	the plan was to run double sockets to every room in the house with some rooms with 4 sockets but never got round to it
2020-10-21 04:20:11	%SBL	Wot
2020-10-21 04:20:22	%SBL	Gib
2020-10-21 04:20:29	Flexyjerkov	so it's currently just sat there collecting dust :P
2020-10-21 04:20:53	Flexyjerkov	it has a nice web UI on it though
2020-10-21 04:21:12	%SBL	Gibbin kurwa

2020-10-21 04:21:39	%SBL	I just noticed this lil managed switch has cable testing
2020-10-21 04:21:47	%SBL	Dunno if that's common for managed switches
2020-10-21 04:21:51	Flexyjerkov	yep usually is
2020-10-21 04:21:52	%SBL	But gawd that's fuckin amazing
2020-10-21 04:21:56	Flexyjerkov	checks length
2020-10-21 04:21:58	%SBL	I need that
2020-10-21 04:22:00	%SBL	Yeah that's great
2020-10-21 04:22:04	Flexyjerkov	and if theres a break in it :D
2020-10-21 04:22:10	%SBL	Ye
2020-10-21 04:22:25	Flexyjerkov	really helpful if your switch is next to your PC ;)

2020-10-21 04:23:04	%SBL	U do
2020-10-21 04:23:06	Flexyjerkov	it's hogging precious hypervisor memory
2020-10-21 04:23:21	%SBL	Also like
2020-10-21 04:23:24	%SBL	I want cable test
2020-10-21 04:23:29	%SBL	For the long cable
2020-10-21 04:23:40	%SBL	Maybe even plural if I decide to wire the house proper
2020-10-21 04:23:54	Flexyjerkov	maybe one day i'll get round to doing it myself
2020-10-21 04:24:05	Flexyjerkov	i ever gutted out under the stairs to turn it into a comms cabinet
2020-10-21 04:24:22	Flexyjerkov	but so far all the comms just sit on top of a shelf
2020-10-21 04:24:33	Flexyjerkov	sounding like a jet engine

2020-10-21 04:28:34	emu_spy	i never quite got homelab people
2020-10-21 04:28:39	%SBL	It's fun
2020-10-21 04:28:41	emu_spy	what are they even doing with all that

2020-10-21 04:29:05	%SBL	Doing whatever the hell they do
2020-10-21 04:29:21	%SBL	Honestly tho Pis are super handy
2020-10-21 04:29:27	Flexyjerkov	emu, i have a small lab myself, but it would all fit in a 6U cabinet
2020-10-21 04:29:44	emu_spy	the pi is overhyped imo
2020-10-21 04:29:45	Flexyjerkov	small setup and purely to run various services
2020-10-21 04:29:53	Flexyjerkov	pi's are shite ;)
2020-10-21 04:29:54	%SBL	Dunno watchu mean by overhyped
2020-10-21 04:29:58	%SBL	It's a small cheap computer
2020-10-21 04:30:00	%SBL	That does shit
2020-10-21 04:30:06	%SBL	And it works well
2020-10-21 04:30:17	Flexyjerkov	well...
2020-10-21 04:30:20	%SBL	Dunno what could be overhyped about that 
2020-10-21 04:30:27	emu_spy	it's just a small box that can do very small server tasks
2020-10-21 04:30:31	%SBL	Yes
2020-10-21 04:30:53	emu_spy	people act like it's the best thing sine the 386
2020-10-21 04:31:01	emu_spy	*since
2020-10-21 04:31:07	%SBL	Well it's great exactly because of what it is
2020-10-21 04:31:10	Flexyjerkov	only thing i see a pi being good for is pi-hole
2020-10-21 04:31:20	emu_spy	hell it wasn't even usable as a desktop until the 4 came out
2020-10-21 04:31:20	Flexyjerkov	and even then, you dont need a pi for that.
2020-10-21 04:31:25	%SBL	I mean
2020-10-21 04:31:32	%SBL	The point of the Pi was never to be a desktop
2020-10-21 04:31:39	%SBL	Some people saw fit to use it as such
2020-10-21 04:31:44	Flexyjerkov	it was for people who couldn't do arduino ;)
2020-10-21 04:31:45	%SBL	Which I guess if they wanna why not
2020-10-21 04:32:00	%SBL	U mean ppl who needed more than an Arduino
2020-10-21 04:32:03	emu_spy	well yeah but there's a bunch of applications where you'd want to do desktop-like tasks
2020-10-21 04:32:10	%SBL	I've never used the GPIO in mine 
2020-10-21 04:32:14	emu_spy	even if it's not actually a desktop machine
2020-10-21 04:32:16	%SBL	Tho I should someday
2020-10-21 04:32:25	%SBL	Funny lil box the Pi
2020-10-21 04:32:52	emu_spy	can't wait for them to update the zero
2020-10-21 04:33:07	emu_spy	now the zero, THERE'S an impressive machine
2020-10-21 04:33:07	%SBL	We never really got the Zero at decent prices here
2020-10-21 04:33:11	%SBL	They were like
2020-10-21 04:33:17	%SBL	Giving it away for nothing in the UK
2020-10-21 04:33:22	emu_spy	shit can fit in an altoids tin
2020-10-21 04:33:24	%SBL	And here it was dumb expensive

2020-10-21 04:42:59	%SBL	Didn't the oldest one learn Linux
2020-10-21 04:43:01	%SBL	Or was learning it
2020-10-21 04:43:11	Flexyjerkov	yea but his PC is still windows
2020-10-21 04:43:16	%SBL	Ah
2020-10-21 04:43:18	<--	Heimdallur (Heimdallur@snoonet.org/user/Heimdallur) has quit (Connection closed)
2020-10-21 04:43:36	Flexyjerkov	he messaged me today while at school saying: I'm at school, using manjaro linux laptop, very cool btw
2020-10-21 04:43:39	%SBL	Honestly like
2020-10-21 04:43:44	Flexyjerkov	least hes managed to figure something out himself
2020-10-21 04:43:48	%SBL	Before expensive network shit
2020-10-21 04:43:52	Flexyjerkov	like pamac ;)
2020-10-21 04:43:54	%SBL	I want M O A R    H A R D    D R I V E S
2020-10-21 04:43:57	emu_spy	coolest school in existence using manjaro
2020-10-21 04:44:01	Flexyjerkov	oh no, this is his laptop
2020-10-21 04:44:06	Flexyjerkov	but his school does use kali
2020-10-21 04:44:10	emu_spy	damn
2020-10-21 04:44:20	%SBL	I'm starting to fill up the new 4TB disk
2020-10-21 04:44:21	%SBL	Well
2020-10-21 04:44:22	Flexyjerkov	his school teaches cyber security/ethical hacking
2020-10-21 04:44:22	%SBL	"new"
2020-10-21 04:44:29	emu_spy	i went to a tech magnet and they still stuck us with ubuntu 14.04
2020-10-21 04:44:34	Flexyjerkov	so i guess "kali" is the obvious choice
2020-10-21 04:44:38	emu_spy	in 2019
2020-10-21 04:44:38	%SBL	You know what's funny
2020-10-21 04:44:46	Flexyjerkov	go on?
2020-10-21 04:45:02	%SBL	In my school, the only ones using Linux are the math department ppl
2020-10-21 04:45:12	%SBL	The computer ppl use fukin Windows
2020-10-21 04:45:15	%SBL	Like
2020-10-21 04:45:20	%SBL	Pls
2020-10-21 04:45:36	Flexyjerkov	because, Active Directory!
2020-10-21 04:45:43	%SBL	Ew
2020-10-21 04:45:44	Flexyjerkov	and yes there's ldap
2020-10-21 04:45:44	@Shamendoo	Yeah a school is gonna want windows admins
2020-10-21 04:45:54	%SBL	Windows bad
2020-10-21 04:45:58	emu_spy	i knew a guy who got sent to the office for using tree on cmd once
2020-10-21 04:46:02	Flexyjerkov	I used to be a school IT admin :(
2020-10-21 04:46:02	aboftybot	Woo!, we hit 1500 lines so far, today!
2020-10-21 04:46:02	%SBL	But yeah most of the shit is Windows
2020-10-21 04:46:02	%SBL	Like
2020-10-21 04:46:04	Flexyjerkov	back in like 2003/2008 server days
2020-10-21 04:46:10	%SBL	Most of the shit is Microsoft, actually
2020-10-21 04:46:23	Flexyjerkov	it helps that schools get heavy cost reductions on licensing
2020-10-21 04:46:32	%SBL	We have Microsoft logins and you can login with that shit into any compooter in the school
2020-10-21 04:46:36	emu_spy	wow, your it guys know how to use active directory?
2020-10-21 04:46:37	Flexyjerkov	and "Windows" is what businesses use
2020-10-21 04:46:39	%SBL	It does some sort of network thingy
2020-10-21 04:46:55	%SBL	But the thing is you have your virtual desktop you can access from any computer in the network
2020-10-21 04:46:59	%SBL	Well, any school compooter
2020-10-21 04:47:02	%SBL	WiFi is a separate thing
2020-10-21 04:47:12	Flexyjerkov	emu_spy: most schools use a windows domain of sorts
2020-10-21 04:47:22	%SBL	And I dunno if they'd be happy with me plugging myself into their switches lol
2020-10-21 04:47:23	%aboft	boo windows
2020-10-21 04:47:25	%SBL	I could
2020-10-21 04:47:26	Flexyjerkov	only way to manage devices easily, with gpo
2020-10-21 04:47:28	%SBL	But dunno
2020-10-21 04:47:38	%SBL	aboft: ur a Windows user tho
2020-10-21 04:47:40	%SBL	cuz u gey
2020-10-21 04:47:49	Flexyjerkov	SBL... If they don't have MAC filtering on ports i'd say it's fair game
2020-10-21 04:47:51	%aboft	rarely
2020-10-21 04:47:57	%SBL	Honestly idk
2020-10-21 04:47:59	%SBL	But like
2020-10-21 04:48:07	%SBL	I could simply unplug a computer
2020-10-21 04:48:12	%SBL	And clone its MAC address
2020-10-21 04:48:21	%SBL	If you just leave the switch exposed like
2020-10-21 04:48:25	Flexyjerkov	i support Windows/OSX users daily in my job, but wouldn't use Windows again as my primary
2020-10-21 04:48:26	%SBL	What's the point of MAC filtering
2020-10-21 04:48:33	%SBL	Anyways
2020-10-21 04:48:36	Flexyjerkov	lots...
2020-10-21 04:48:43	%aboft	mac filtering good
2020-10-21 04:48:44	Flexyjerkov	I use mac filtering on my network
2020-10-21 04:49:05	%SBL	I could plug the cable to my compooter anyways
2020-10-21 04:49:11	%SBL	Even if the switch wasn't exposed
2020-10-21 04:49:19	%SBL	Flexyjerkov: u can just clone MAC addresses
2020-10-21 04:49:24	%SBL	It's not really security
2020-10-21 04:49:27	Flexyjerkov	i restrict DHCP to known devices and have Static ARP entries enabled
2020-10-21 04:49:41	Flexyjerkov	only way of getting on mine is spoofing the mac and IP
2020-10-21 04:49:41	%aboft	SBL: you have to already know a valid mac tho
2020-10-21 04:49:44	emu_spy	wait like a home network?
2020-10-21 04:49:48	Flexyjerkov	yes?
2020-10-21 04:49:55	emu_spy	because if so that's massively overkill
2020-10-21 04:49:59	Flexyjerkov	i have a wireless network which could be compromised...
2020-10-21 04:50:15	@Shamendoo	Some people are really into home networking emu_spy 
2020-10-21 04:50:17	%SBL	aboft: well duh, my point is I can just bring my computer and unplug the school computer and plug the cable into mine
2020-10-21 04:50:29	%aboft	SBL: not with mac filtering
2020-10-21 04:50:33	%SBL	...
2020-10-21 04:50:43	Flexyjerkov	also SBL...
2020-10-21 04:50:49	%SBL	If I have access to the school computer, I know what its MAC is
2020-10-21 04:50:51	Flexyjerkov	some ports have disconnect detection
2020-10-21 04:51:02	Flexyjerkov	if you unplug it, you cant re-establish link till approved on switch end
2020-10-21 04:51:03	%aboft	^
2020-10-21 04:51:18	Flexyjerkov	which is also a nice feature,
2020-10-21 04:51:23	%SBL	Flexyjerkov: that's a fair point
2020-10-21 04:51:39	%SBL	I dunno if they have it enabled
2020-10-21 04:51:44	%SBL	Probably not since I always unplug shit
2020-10-21 04:51:47	Flexyjerkov	best thing to do on a network is hope they don't have loopback detection/packet storms
2020-10-21 04:51:55	Flexyjerkov	plug one socket to another
2020-10-21 04:51:59	Flexyjerkov	wait for VLAN to fall over
2020-10-21 04:52:01	%SBL	lol
2020-10-21 04:52:12	Flexyjerkov	or whole network if it's a flat one
2020-10-21 04:52:14	%SBL	I'm pretty sure even the most retarded switches have loop detection
2020-10-21 04:52:25	%SBL	And there's really no good reason to turn it off
2020-10-21 04:52:26	Flexyjerkov	you'd be suprised if it's turned on by default
2020-10-21 04:52:37	%SBL	Dunno
2020-10-21 04:52:37	Flexyjerkov	most HP switches and Netgears are off by default
2020-10-21 04:52:41	%SBL	Really?
2020-10-21 04:52:44	Flexyjerkov	yep,
2020-10-21 04:52:49	%SBL	The TP Link ones have it on by default
2020-10-21 04:53:03	%SBL	So does Cisco
2020-10-21 04:53:14	Flexyjerkov	some HP switches i come across were a nightmare as you had to apply it by port if i recall and it was CLI based
2020-10-21 04:53:28	%SBL	Are HP switches bad
2020-10-21 04:53:31	Flexyjerkov	i mean Cisco CLI is bad, but this was horrible
2020-10-21 04:53:35	%SBL	I don't like the CLI for Cisco switches
2020-10-21 04:53:39	Flexyjerkov	hmm when they work they're good
2020-10-21 04:53:41	%SBL	Damn worse than Cisco CLI
2020-10-21 04:53:46	%SBL	That's rough
2020-10-21 04:54:01	%aboft	i dont remember the cisco cli being bad but its been 5 years
2020-10-21 04:54:06	<--	random-nick (random-nick@user/random-nick) has quit (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
2020-10-21 04:54:08	Flexyjerkov	it's the same sort of shit, enable > set interface eth0/1 --------
2020-10-21 04:54:19	%SBL	My problem with Cisco's IOS is that the documentation isn't always right
2020-10-21 04:54:26	%SBL	And what is supposed to work, doesn't always work
2020-10-21 04:54:31	Flexyjerkov	oh i know, and it changes!
2020-10-21 04:54:33	%SBL	There's some way to do it, naturally
2020-10-21 04:54:38	%SBL	But yeah they like changing shit
2020-10-21 04:54:40	%SBL	And it's confusing
2020-10-21 04:54:41	Flexyjerkov	also they charge a shit ton for firmware updates
2020-10-21 04:54:52	%SBL	Fukin Cisco
2020-10-21 04:54:58	Flexyjerkov	kinda worse than apple really
2020-10-21 04:55:05	%SBL	I mean I get it's nice to run a full Cisco network
2020-10-21 04:55:05	Flexyjerkov	least OSX is free now :P
2020-10-21 04:55:08	%SBL	But man
2020-10-21 04:55:11	%SBL	Fuckin Cisco again
2020-10-21 04:55:15	Flexyjerkov	oh it's not
2020-10-21 04:55:25	%SBL	I mean like
2020-10-21 04:55:27	Flexyjerkov	i used to manage a cisco UCCM years back
2020-10-21 04:55:28	%SBL	For a big organization
2020-10-21 04:55:35	%SBL	It's easier to just install Cisco everything
2020-10-21 04:55:44	Flexyjerkov	horrible phone system management
2020-10-21 04:55:50	%aboft	my buddy has his own company doing IT shit
2020-10-21 04:55:50	Flexyjerkov	for a contact centre :(

2020-10-21 04:56:01	Flexyjerkov	oh damn aboft, so do i
2020-10-21 04:56:03	%SBL	I forget what my school uses
2020-10-21 04:56:11	Flexyjerkov	their switches, especially POE ones are beautiful
2020-10-21 04:56:19	%aboft	i need to relearn the switch/router cli
2020-10-21 04:56:28	Flexyjerkov	their cams and wireless points are also perfect
2020-10-21 04:56:30	%aboft	i never fucking use it 
2020-10-21 04:56:43	Flexyjerkov	i rarely touch CLI these days,
2020-10-21 04:57:03	%aboft	you use the setup gui?
2020-10-21 04:57:21	%aboft	sometimes I hate guis
2020-10-21 04:57:28	%aboft	i get lost in my own soho router GUI
2020-10-21 04:57:31	%SBL	Hm
2020-10-21 04:57:33	Flexyjerkov	for switches i use i tend to use a cli
2020-10-21 04:57:34	%SBL	Is Buffalo shit good
2020-10-21 04:57:39	Flexyjerkov	the netgear switches have a nice CLI
2020-10-21 04:57:49	Flexyjerkov	buffalo is budget SAN/NAS kit?

2020-10-21 04:59:34	Flexyjerkov	those are nice units
2020-10-21 04:59:38	%SBL	My school uses MikroTik
2020-10-21 04:59:41	%SBL	That's the one
2020-10-21 04:59:44	%SBL	Dunno if it's good
2020-10-21 04:59:46	%SBL	But they use that
2020-10-21 05:00:06	Flexyjerkov	For its total, non‐blocking throughput, the 24‐port model supports up to 26 Gbps, while the 48-port model supports up to 70 Gbps.
2020-10-21 05:00:19	Flexyjerkov	70gbps of yummy bandwidth
2020-10-21 05:00:42	Flexyjerkov	the gui for unifi switches etc is the best though
2020-10-21 05:00:52	Flexyjerkov	it's remotely managed by a "Unifi Controller", 
2020-10-21 05:01:01	Flexyjerkov	usually something like a debian box
2020-10-21 05:01:09	Flexyjerkov	manage all your kit on 1 place
2020-10-21 05:01:42	Flexyjerkov	A single instance of the UniFi Controller running in the cloud can manage multiple UniFi sites within a centralized interface.  (I guess people run it in the cloud now)
2020-10-21 05:02:33	%SBL	Huh
2020-10-21 05:02:37	%SBL	MikroTik is Latvian

2020-10-21 05:16:03	Flexyjerkov	ye well wireless is wank
2020-10-21 05:16:17	Flexyjerkov	the idea that anything "over the air" is secure is a joke
2020-10-21 05:16:45	@Shamendoo	eh
2020-10-21 05:16:51	@Shamendoo	That's not really a limiting factor
2020-10-21 05:17:13	@Shamendoo	WPA is just shit
2020-10-21 05:17:23	%SBL	Gib WEP
2020-10-21 05:17:27	@Shamendoo	It could be not shit, but it isn't
2020-10-21 05:17:56	%SBL	I wish I could do VLANs in the router to isolate the wireless traffic
2020-10-21 05:18:06	%SBL	That's partly why I fancy the managed switch
2020-10-21 05:18:11	%SBL	But I'd have to change my router too
2020-10-21 05:18:12	%SBL	Well
2020-10-21 05:18:23	%SBL	Actually nvm I don't think I've ever checked whether my router does VLANs
2020-10-21 05:18:26	%SBL	Maybe it does
2020-10-21 05:18:47	@Shamendoo	It probably supports at least a guest network
2020-10-21 05:19:00	@Shamendoo	Whether it's actually isolated or not dunno
2020-10-21 05:20:19	Flexyjerkov	you might be able to get away from having a switch if you can tag your ports on your device to a VLAN and can configure VLAN's on your existing router?
2020-10-21 05:20:46	%SBL	Thing is
2020-10-21 05:20:56	Flexyjerkov	i know on my pfsense box i can create "VLAN networks" and just have specific tagged traffic go through it
2020-10-21 05:21:29	%SBL	If the router doesn't support VLANs, either it's gonna spit out the packets to anyone without checking or maybe it'll error out
2020-10-21 05:21:36	%SBL	Dunno don't think it would error out with tagged traffic

2020-10-21 06:41:26	cmj	ugh
2020-10-21 06:41:28	%aboft	the "owing" of money isn't the same as you and I owing for school
2020-10-21 06:41:36	%SBL	...
2020-10-21 06:41:41	%SBL	U talkin to me like I'm retarded
2020-10-21 06:42:01	Flexyjerkov	honestly, if trump owes as much money as people are saying then i'd say it's the banks who are fucked :P
2020-10-21 06:42:08	%SBL	Well
2020-10-21 06:42:14	%SBL	Thing is he still has a lot of valuable real estate
2020-10-21 06:42:19	%SBL	So technically they can foreclose on him
2020-10-21 06:42:23	%aboft	I dont believe I am, I apologize if you find offense. I'm just trying to point out that the media phrases it very negatively when Trump is actually far better off than most seem to think
2020-10-21 06:42:28	%SBL	That's what they were talkin bout tho
2020-10-21 06:43:07	Flexyjerkov	im sure he's quite well off aboft but his debts will catch up with him...
2020-10-21 06:43:09	%aboft	Flexyjerkov: I say that shit about me all the time. If someone tries to come after me for something big, I'm not afraid to file chapter 7 or 11 and just start over.
2020-10-21 06:43:10	Flexyjerkov	it's not gonna benefit him
2020-10-21 06:43:39	%aboft	Flexyjerkov: theres a difference between his budget and his companies budgets
2020-10-21 06:43:59	Flexyjerkov	knowing trump he'd want everything under his name though...
2020-10-21 06:44:04	%aboft	the man just gets by with tax cuts which will continue happening
2020-10-21 06:44:11	%SBL	aboft: I mean you're ascribing popular opinion to me for no good reason I can see
2020-10-21 06:44:21	%SBL	Also like
2020-10-21 06:44:55	%SBL	The whole point of him running for president was nothing more than money
2020-10-21 06:45:07	%SBL	It was a publicity stunt
2020-10-21 06:45:17	Flexyjerkov	everything he does s publicity
2020-10-21 06:45:18	%SBL	And he memed his way to winning lol
2020-10-21 06:45:24	%SBL	Yea
2020-10-21 06:45:26	%aboft	oh yes
2020-10-21 06:45:31	%aboft	definitely for publicity
2020-10-21 06:45:41	%aboft	but he has done good things for our economy
2020-10-21 06:45:45	%SBL	I mean I guess if he's good at something it's that, getting attention
2020-10-21 06:45:52	%aboft	he inherited a decent economy from obama and really has only gone up with ti
2020-10-21 06:46:10	%SBL	But really the only reason he ever stayed afloat was dumb luck
2020-10-21 06:46:12	%aboft	anyways I highly doubt biden would ever win
2020-10-21 06:46:19	Flexyjerkov	sadly his handling of spikey virus has not helped that argument aboft
2020-10-21 06:46:20	%aboft	just along from his corporate tax and gun plans
2020-10-21 06:46:23	%SBL	And well it's hard to go to shit when you start out your life with that much money

2020-10-21 22:27:54	%aboft	like we can reuse functions and implement on server
2020-10-21 22:28:00	%audron	you can also split it, do frontend in react and api in rust
2020-10-21 22:28:01	%aboft	we could make sockets

2020-10-21 22:30:29	%aboft	wait
2020-10-21 22:30:34	%aboft	you can implement frontend react
2020-10-21 22:30:35	%audron	or a websocket if you need more interactive
2020-10-21 22:30:35	%aboft	fucking duh

2020-10-21 23:14:44	%gonzobot	aboft you befriended a duck in 2.393 seconds! You have made friends with 321 ducks in #linuxmasterrace.
2020-10-21 23:14:55	%SBL	no
2020-10-21 23:15:01	%SBL	@+!k aboft 
2020-10-21 23:20:04	-->	drakonis (drakonis@user/Drakonis) has joined #linuxmasterrace
2020-10-21 23:20:29	%aboft	audron: so lets say I use the /NAMES command in irc
2020-10-21 23:20:54	%aboft	if I did that in rust through the socket would I need to parse into a vector and send that vector through the get route?
2020-10-21 23:21:00	%aboft	so I can manipulate the array in js?
2020-10-21 23:21:58	%aboft	basically I just want to be able to do like `names.map(name => name.user)` type thing
2020-10-21 23:22:32	%aboft	but if its a vec I wont need the dot whatever
2020-10-21 23:25:15	%SBL	I don't get why people in their first compooter course have so much trouble understanding arrays
2020-10-21 23:25:18	%SBL	Like
2020-10-21 23:25:29	%SBL	Dunno they've always seemed pretty ez
2020-10-21 23:25:49	%aboft	arrays were easy to understand for me but trying to think of things to do with arrays made it hard
2020-10-21 23:26:07	%aboft	like I only knew when to use them when I was told or a quesiton hinted at something
2020-10-21 23:26:12	%aboft	now I use arrays for like everything
2020-10-21 23:26:25	%audron	aboft: you serialize and deserialize as json for transport
2020-10-21 23:26:27	+SubWatch	Link post: "Hell has frozen over..." posted in /r/linuxmasterrace by rstrube. http://redd.it/jfg5ka
2020-10-21 23:26:36	%SBL	Hm
2020-10-21 23:26:36	%aboft	audron: makes sense
2020-10-21 23:26:37	%SBL	Dunno
2020-10-21 23:26:44	%SBL	I always just understood arrays intuitively
2020-10-21 23:27:05	%SBL	Also when you tell em you can put an array in an array to make a matrix, their heads just blow
2020-10-21 23:27:14	%aboft	i hate matricies
2020-10-21 23:27:15	%SBL	tbf they're not studying compooter shit
2020-10-21 23:27:17	%SBL	But still
2020-10-21 23:27:18	%SBL	aboft: y
2020-10-21 23:27:25	%SBL	Matrices useful
2020-10-21 23:27:26	%SBL	Very power
2020-10-21 23:27:30	%SBL	Lin alg good
2020-10-21 23:27:30	%audron	so ye if you do names and it lists something it makes sense parsing that into a vector
2020-10-21 23:27:37	%aboft	because whenever I need them its for calculating shit which I fucking hate doing
2020-10-21 23:27:42	%SBL	lmao
2020-10-21 23:27:49	%SBL	Calculating shit is fun
2020-10-21 23:27:54	%aboft	not for me
2020-10-21 23:27:58	%aboft	thats why I dont make games
2020-10-21 23:28:01	%aboft	fuck x,y,z coords
2020-10-21 23:28:03	%SBL	Fair enough
2020-10-21 23:28:04	%audron	calcuating shit is for computers
2020-10-21 23:28:16	%SBL	audron: well telling the compooter to calculate shit
2020-10-21 23:28:19	%SBL	U kno what we mean
2020-10-21 23:28:26	%audron	no
2020-10-21 23:29:08	%aboft	SBL: like fuck man
2020-10-21 23:29:22	%aboft	i was doing a course using some js library for physics shit
2020-10-21 23:29:30	%aboft	and made a simple maze generation game
2020-10-21 23:29:32	%aboft	fuck that
2020-10-21 23:29:40	%audron	waht is /names anyways
2020-10-21 23:29:49	%aboft	list all the names in the server
2020-10-21 23:29:55	%audron	ah
2020-10-21 23:30:04	%audron	that is your client aliasing that to /names then
2020-10-21 23:30:26	%audron	well
2020-10-21 23:30:28	%SBL	aboft: dis me rn https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ek3bjjgW0AIqmaa?format=png&name=small
2020-10-21 23:30:30	%audron	ye and no
2020-10-21 23:30:30	%aboft	i think its an irc command
2020-10-21 23:30:36	%audron	the / things are client shit
2020-10-21 23:30:42	%audron	but yes it is NAMES for the protocol
2020-10-21 23:30:44	%audron	if you do raw shit
2020-10-21 23:30:45	%aboft	ye
2020-10-21 23:30:50	%aboft	which I will be doing
2020-10-21 23:30:55	%aboft	because the socket will be in irc

2020-10-22 00:55:18	%SBL	cmj: buy me radio 
2020-10-22 00:55:59	cmj	i mean. you probably shouldn't be TXing, so just get the nano and you can get all sorts of bands
2020-10-22 00:56:40	%SBL	You can't really get HAM licenses here anymore
2020-10-22 00:56:46	%SBL	I mean it's technically possible
2020-10-22 00:56:48	%SBL	But not really
2020-10-22 00:56:49	cmj	it's very handy. i just got it because the rtl-sdr ones are kind of bulky and antenna is a pain
2020-10-22 00:57:26	cmj	but they're all around the same price for starter kits
