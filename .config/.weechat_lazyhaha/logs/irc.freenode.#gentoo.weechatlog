2020-05-23 00:13:35	ggabriel	oh, and for best practice do backup.tar.xz

2020-05-23 00:14:13	ggabriel	so, basically, I use gzip for speed, if I don't need to compress so much

2020-05-23 07:35:44	Kangie	Hey All. emerge --depclean on a machine that I just setup wants to remove a ton of dependencies. Obviously they're not in the world file, but I'm confused as to why. Stuff like xfce4-screensaver doesn't come with xfce-meta, so I would have had to install that manually.
2020-05-23 07:35:59	Kangie	but I wouldn't install xfce4 screensaver as oneshot, so it should be in the world file.

2020-05-23 07:43:46	Kangie	Ah well. It looks like a whole bunch of ruby stuff is most of the issue.
2020-05-23 07:44:07	Kangie	I'll either add them to the world file or depclean and then install the packages properly.
2020-05-23 07:44:15	+kurly	could be that it was a dependency at some point but is no longer
2020-05-23 07:44:36	Kangie	Yeah. I'll see how I go. Got a spare linux laptop and a liveUSB here, so I doubt I can break the system too badly.
2020-05-23 07:44:39	Kangie	Cheers fellas.
2020-05-23 07:44:44	+kurly	many of the ruby packages are very small
2020-05-23 07:44:59	+kurly	so it looks like a mess when they hit depclean, but maybe not as big a deal as it seems
2020-05-23 07:45:36	+kurly	Kangie: there is also unmerge-backup for FEATURES
2020-05-23 07:46:00	Kangie	Yeah, there's a whole bunch of gst-plugins as well
2020-05-23 07:46:03	Kangie	kurly, I'll look into it.
2020-05-23 07:46:04	+kurly	Kangie: see the description in 'man make.conf' ... it will create quickpkg during depclean, in case you change your mind, it is very fast to reinstall (using -k or -K for example)
2020-05-23 07:46:40	Kangie	It's only 65 packages, tbh. I wonder if my use flags changed...
2020-05-23 07:46:42	Melchior	oh; if only I had known that -"unmerge backup"...

2020-10-21 02:38:14	kchibisov	shoober420: just add -elogind to it.
2020-10-21 02:38:17	+iamben	you probably want to create a package.use entry to disable elogind on xorg-server (and enable suid on it)
2020-10-21 02:38:33	shoober420	no, i want no trace of elogind on my system
2020-10-21 02:38:42	shoober420	i think s6-66 pulled it in, but i dont want it
2020-10-21 02:38:47	kchibisov	do you see a '-' shoober420 ?
2020-10-21 02:38:58	+iamben	i think xorg-server is pulling it in
2020-10-21 02:38:58	kchibisov	it means that it disables elogind.
2020-10-21 02:39:06	shoober420	yes i saw
2020-10-21 02:39:27	kchibisov	So if you add '-elogind' to either package.use for xorg-server or make.conf's USE variable you won't see elogind.
2020-10-21 02:39:28	+iamben	if elogind is installed now, "emerge -cpv elogind" will show exactly what depends on it

2020-10-21 02:46:45	shoober420	but those are not all the build options for xorg-server
2020-10-21 02:46:53	paradox991	ratrace Maybe I'm misunderstanding how compiling php on gentoo works. Do the extensions still need to be loaded from the php.ini?
2020-10-21 02:47:00	ratrace	yes
2020-10-21 02:47:15	paradox991	Yes then. I've enabled mysqli among others and it's erroring out when starting.
2020-10-21 02:47:16	shoober420	does this mean they cant be disabled?
2020-10-21 02:47:21	ratrace	the USE flags only pull in deps and install the modules, but you need to enable them
2020-10-21 02:47:23	+iamben	shoober420: not everything that CAN be optional, is made optional.  each new optional flag adds testing complexity.  but you can hack up a custom ebuild if you like.
2020-10-21 02:47:42	paradox991	Disable the extensions, no errors.
2020-10-21 02:47:46	shoober420	dang

2020-10-21 02:50:16	+iamben	shoober420: is it possible that most of those match the defaults?
2020-10-21 02:50:17	+sam_	know how stuff works THEN screw it up
2020-10-21 02:50:18	kchibisov	shoober420: it doesn't matter what are you using for your setup, it's about providing miminal working defualts that makes sense.
2020-10-21 02:50:32	kchibisov	If you don't like those, create your own overlay and tweak ebuilds the way you want.
2020-10-21 02:50:37	+sam_	also you are free to use xorg without elogind or systemd
2020-10-21 02:50:39	kchibisov	it's pretty straightforward.
2020-10-21 02:50:49	shoober420	i understand the defaults, but not having options to disable bloat on a distro that boats its customization is silly
2020-10-21 02:51:02	shoober420	i have to create a custom ebuild just to disable some use flags that should already be provided?
2020-10-21 02:51:04	+sam_	you get that the complexity blows up fast, right?
2020-10-21 02:51:06	ratrace	paradox991: hrm.... I'm not by my workstation right now so I can't check correct library paths.
2020-10-21 02:51:14	+iamben	shoober420: but is it possible that the things you want to disable, are already disabled? that's my point.
2020-10-21 02:51:20	+sam_	you are free to fork the ebuild OR use EXTRA_ECONF
2020-10-21 02:51:24	+sam_	which is an extremely powerful tool
2020-10-21 02:51:36	+sam_	(it lets you pass arguments to configure via the environment)
2020-10-21 02:51:41	shoober420	i bet you they are not
2020-10-21 02:51:51	shoober420	if it goes by the defaults the build script uses
2020-10-21 02:51:54	shoober420	they are for sure enabled
2020-10-21 02:52:04	shoober420	for compatibility reasons understandabley
2020-10-21 02:52:13	+sam_	then use extra econf to disable them
2020-10-21 02:52:14	shoober420	but im not here to board the bloat boat
2020-10-21 02:52:16	+sam_	or use a forked ebuild

2020-10-21 02:53:31	Kelsar	literally all the stuff there are USE or seperate ebuilds as far as i can see
2020-10-21 02:54:44	shoober420	im just shocked not all build flags are included in the gentoo flags
2020-10-21 02:54:51	Kelsar	they are not
2020-10-21 02:54:54	shoober420	i was expecting customization off the bat

2020-10-21 02:54:59	+iamben	shoober420: some things are not worth making optional

2020-10-21 02:55:26	shoober420	if this is a build from source distro, you would think the flag selection is the most important thing
2020-10-21 02:55:28	Kelsar	but can this channel please go back to support from pointless ranting?
2020-10-21 02:55:35	shoober420	ok, so i need to make a custom ebuild
2020-10-21 02:55:38	shoober420	is it hard?
2020-10-21 02:55:44	+iamben	it's not hard if you are willing to learn
2020-10-21 02:56:01	+iamben	do you read bash code ok?
2020-10-21 02:56:07	shoober420	i just thought the build flags would be there already, im just baffled
2020-10-21 02:56:14	shoober420	its all good
2020-10-21 02:56:20	zgu	probably uses zsh instead of bash to reduce bloat
2020-10-21 02:56:23	Alfr	shoober420, and who's going to test that the flag combinations work?
2020-10-21 02:56:24	shoober420	yikes
2020-10-21 02:56:31	+iamben	we do not have flags to set every single configure option for every package-- for some we take defaults, for some we force on or off
2020-10-21 02:56:40	+sam_	2^n complexity is not needed thanks

2020-10-21 02:56:46	shoober420	its his own fault not the distros
2020-10-21 02:56:48	+iamben	we usually have flags for the thigns that people care about configuring
2020-10-21 02:56:51	shoober420	have sane defaults
2020-10-21 02:56:55	+sam_	like i said you can easily configure it if you want

2020-10-21 03:07:43	ionen	edlou: 5.9.x will refuse to load the uvm module (without a patch to bypass licensing conflict), thus cuda won't work

2020-10-21 03:11:54	shoober420	i boasts its use flags, but doesnt include all build flags
2020-10-21 03:11:57	edlou	shoober420: you can tweak everything, granularly, but the more specific you want things obviously more work some will take

2020-10-21 03:12:33	+kurly	shoober420: that doesn't really answer my question, but okay. let's try another way: what are you trying to achieve?
2020-10-21 03:12:35	ionen	edlou: that's a kernel patch by the way
2020-10-21 03:12:38	ionen	not for nvidia
2020-10-21 03:12:48	edlou	oh -.-
2020-10-21 03:13:04	edlou	well i mean, already using some virtualbox patches, might as well recompile! lol
2020-10-21 03:13:10	ionen	it disregard the licensing issues without actually changing functionality
2020-10-21 03:13:36	edlou	this wont put my driver at a large vulnerability will it?
2020-10-21 03:13:44	Alfr	shoober420, they simply are not. Deal with it. Nothing stops you creating an overlay with what you want or use extra_econf as mentionened above.

2020-10-21 03:14:11	ionen	edlou: if in doubt, 5.8.x should still be supported for a while, nvidia said they'll fix it by mid-november or so
2020-10-21 03:14:36	ionen	I assume by rewriting kernel code inside their own module so they don't need those symbols
2020-10-21 03:14:53	ratrace	paradox991: and where does the package install files? maybe the config dir is misconfigured?

2020-10-21 03:31:07	+iamben	the package.env method is good if you have the SAME options on multiple packages, the env/category/pkg method may be better if every package has its own options

2020-10-21 04:01:16	+iamben	lino: if it's not in the final phase where it's merging files to the live FS (a very small part of the process) then it's generally safe.  if you happen to be in the middle of an update of a large collection like qt, it COULD cause some minor dep conflicts that you need to deal with next emerge

2020-10-21 06:17:50	+wraeth	xpoint: I have NextCloud installed and running successfully on php-7.4, which means it's not php itself that's at fault. Could be a missing php module, or something in your httpd config that's not set right, but I don't think it's a "failure" in the php package.
2020-10-21 06:18:30	+wraeth	xpoint: Of particular note, if you try to hit your login page and you get no output whatsoever in your httpd logs, it suggests your httpd is either logging somewhere else, not configured to handle the request, or not the one responding.

2020-10-21 18:03:23	Paradox991	How important is keeping no_root_squash disabled on NFS? Realistically if anyone got that level of network access to my network I'd have bigger problems to worry about then my NFS server.
2020-10-21 18:06:11	grawity	well, no, the NFS server is probably the only service that is *incredibly* vulnerable to such spoofed requests
2020-10-21 18:07:16	grawity	all the other network protocols (like SSH) make it much harder to escalate from having root on just 1 client machine to having root on the main file server
2020-10-21 18:07:45	Paradox991	Right, but it's connected to a private network which only a few computers have access
2020-10-21 18:07:58	Paradox991	so if anyone got into that then that means my machine is compromised on the root level already, correct?
2020-10-21 18:08:02	grawity	no
2020-10-21 18:08:24	grawity	and even if it was, that wouldn't necessarily turn into a compromise of the entire network
2020-10-21 18:09:38	grawity	if the machines are all equivalent -- same credentials, same owner, same data -- then disabling root squash is probably more safe
2020-10-21 18:10:13	grawity	I mean, more safe compared to the more usual case where some machines have higher risk stuff than others
2020-10-21 18:10:19	username234	! note Bearcat if it works, I'd say so.  However, looks to me like there are a lot of similar style bugs in that ebuild.

2020-10-21 18:11:39	Paradox991	Does that all apply to nfsv4?

2020-10-21 18:12:05	grawity	v4 has no differences in how the default RPC auth mechanism (AUTH_SYS) operates
2020-10-21 18:12:49	grawity	the v4 specification does include Kerberos auth (the secure alternative) as mandatory to implement, though it was possible to use that with v3 as well
2020-10-21 18:14:08	grawity	but as far as I could tell you're not using sec=krb5, so that doesn't change anything here

2020-10-21 18:15:32	grawity	err, as in NFS "/"
2020-10-21 18:16:01	Paradox991	Hmm
2020-10-21 18:16:11	Paradox991	I'll have to look at kerberos
2020-10-21 18:16:23	grawity	though in that case I would still wonder whether root *needs* write privileges to your data volumes
2020-10-21 18:16:42	Paradox991	In order to mount a .raw image on NFS it has to go through the root user
2020-10-21 18:16:50	Paradox991	Also, adding a secondary NFS server on top of the host was a bad idea.

2020-10-21 18:34:29	+iamben	c-nister_: you are saying that "emerge qt-creator" fails but "emerge --oneshot qtcreator" succeeds?
2020-10-21 18:35:51	c-nister_	iamben, no, emerge of sys-libs/compiler-rt-sanitizers fails ( either in dependency of qt-creator or explicitely ).

2020-10-21 18:36:15	+iamben	-1 on which emerge exactly?
2020-10-21 18:36:45	+iamben	-1 is definitely not what caused it to succeed or fail, there must be other factors (possibly a non-deterministic failure, like parallel make fail)
2020-10-21 18:37:12	+iamben	-1 only affects whether a package is recorded in world (not depcleanable) AFTER the compile succeeds, it does not affect the compilation at all

2020-10-21 20:28:04	ManDay	c-nister_: i think due to this conflict it wants to resolve it by using clang-9 instead
2020-10-21 20:28:19	+iamben	this failure happens if you have llvm-10.0.1 already, as emerge prefers installing additional 9.x slots of everything instead of forcing a few downgrades to 10.0.0 to match the best available libclangformat-ide version 10.0.0
2020-10-21 20:28:21	ManDay	emerge, too clever for the average user...
2020-10-21 20:28:39	+iamben	s/llvm/clang/
2020-10-21 20:28:49	+iamben	if you don't have any versions yet, it will happily use 10.0.0 to begin with
2020-10-21 20:28:57	c-nister_	of clang ?
2020-10-21 20:29:13	c-nister_	so this is one of the few reasons to use --unmerge ???
2020-10-21 20:30:45	+iamben	no i dont really think that is warranted
2020-10-21 20:30:57	+iamben	you could either force downgrade to 10.0.0 ahead of time, or just go with that exclude trick

2020-10-22 00:06:57	ggabriel	when libreoffice should require it on its own
2020-10-22 00:07:05	ggabriel	when was the last time you ran a world update?
2020-10-22 00:09:14	Inepu	ggabriel, perhaps I emerge it for other reasons tht i don't remember
