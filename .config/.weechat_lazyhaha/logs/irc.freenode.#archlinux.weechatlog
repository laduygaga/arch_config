2019-12-09 04:54:31	daria	not compatible with sata molex?
2019-12-09 04:54:39	grawity	daria: photo?
2019-12-09 04:54:48	daria	img is included

2019-12-09 04:55:04	daria	anyway i got to get one of those boxy looking ones then
2019-12-09 04:55:09	daria	with standard connectors?
2019-12-09 04:55:10	grawity	yeah that's M.2 and no it is not compatible with sata molex
2019-12-09 04:55:14	daria	ah
2019-12-09 04:55:22	daria	im limited to sata molex, ssd still an option rite?
2019-12-09 04:55:36	grawity	the more expensive M.2 SSDs aren't even SATA, they're PCIe (the M.2 port can carry both)
2019-12-09 04:55:47	daria	i see
2019-12-09 04:55:52	grawity	yeah I guess you're limited to usual 2.5" inch SATA SSDs
2019-12-09 04:55:57	grawity	but there's still plenty of those as well
2019-12-09 04:55:59	daria	okay thanks
2019-12-09 04:56:03	daria	those seem pricier tho
2019-12-09 04:56:30	grawity	hmm I thought usually M.2 ones are pricier
2019-12-09 04:56:37	daria	not in here

2019-12-09 04:56:51	eXeC64	Seems I've got addr_gen_mode=1 in sysctl. I don't understand how "1: do no generate a link-local address, use EUI64 for addresses generated from autoconf" is different from "0: generate address based on EUI64" Strange phrasing. The behaviour I see sounds much more like "2: generate stable privacy address, RFC7217"
2019-12-09 04:56:58	daria	i could probably fit one of those into a pci-e slot however not on a laptop

2019-12-09 04:58:38	grawity	maybe it's just supply/demand
2019-12-09 04:59:06	daria	well im planning to upgrade a few i3 based notebooks from around 2012
2019-12-09 04:59:13	grawity	like, I'm guessing "860 EVO" SATA M.2 is cheaper than its 2.5" variant because who the fuck wants to buy it if they can get a NVMe M.2 one instead?
2019-12-09 04:59:47	grawity	tbh, it is still standard SATA, so I wonder if there are adapters from M.2 to traditional SATA cabling
2019-12-09 05:00:01	daria	i would buy that

2019-12-09 05:00:39	grawity	I mean why not, it's very few components
2019-12-09 05:00:43	daria	more delivery costs tho so i should stick to sata connector ssd
2019-12-09 05:00:47	grawity	just like the NVMe M.2 to full-size PCIe adapters
2019-12-09 05:00:59	grawity	yeah I don't think you will save much in the end

2019-12-17 02:30:51	ldiamond	How can I get pacman to just refetch it and reinstall it

2019-12-17 03:30:40	ldiamond	yep
2019-12-17 03:30:41	teraflops	get a list and pipe it to pacman

2019-12-17 03:32:03	Foxboron	Yes. man pacman and look at --overwrite
2019-12-17 03:32:16	ldiamond	but is that really a good idea?
2019-12-17 03:32:23	teraflops	something like pacman --asdeps -S $(<pacman -Qqdn)

2020-05-23 00:16:16	mplavsic	hello everyone. I don't know what i did, but i can no longer minimize applications on Arch Linux. The checkbox "show qbittorrent in notification area" is set to false and disabled: it is not possible to set it to true. Similarly, Telegram doesn't even show the notification area settings (they used to be presentin the app settings, and they are still present to a friend of mine who uses Fedora). And even on apps where you can set it (such as Discord
2020-05-23 00:16:18	mplavsic	or Teams). I do not see the app in the notification area (I am using KStatusNotifierItem)

2020-05-23 03:03:33	NetSysFire	and also, if this is your very first installation, try it in a vm first, so you wont brick anything by accident

2020-05-23 03:04:30	NetSysFire	we are just telling you to read the documentation, arch means that you got to do this
2020-05-23 03:04:31	Namarrgon	if you can't make sense of the fdisk output then you have some catching-up to do

2020-05-23 06:02:24	BrainDamage	use -j $(nproc) if you want it to use automatically all cores
2020-05-23 06:02:37	dreisner	i mean, ninja doesn't make you ask to use all cores...
2020-05-23 06:02:43	Dan39	eschwartz: you are running makepkg yourself usually, right? so you woud know if thats the case haha, and shut that off i guess. but sure, i wasn't saying it SHOULD i was just saying i'm surprised it doesn't. maybe that is a good reason it doesn't and therefore me being surprised is just me being ignorant :P
2020-05-23 06:02:51	BrainDamage	what's really insane is that -j without an argument tries to spawn processes until it cannot anymore
2020-05-23 06:03:03	BrainDamage	which often results in the system dying on you

2020-05-23 06:03:41	eschwartz	make, does not default to all cores
2020-05-23 06:03:51	Shipp	b1ack0p: I do arch/windows. You should shrink your windows partition inside of windows first to create free space, then use that space to install arch
2020-05-23 06:03:53	eschwartz	our vendor makepkg.conf, does not override the default Make options
2020-05-23 06:03:53	Dan39	right, i know that haha
2020-05-23 06:04:02	Shipp	linux is pretty meh with ntfs so resizing it inside linux can break your windows partition.
2020-05-23 06:04:09	BrainDamage	well, makepkg does set some cflags by default
2020-05-23 06:04:12	eschwartz	ninja does default to all cores, and we don't override that default either
2020-05-23 06:04:20	BrainDamage	setting make flags bby default would not be a big step further
2020-05-23 06:04:32	eschwartz	cflags and makeflags are quite different
2020-05-23 06:04:47	BrainDamage	I know, one is read by the compiler and the other by the buildsystem
2020-05-23 06:04:54	dreisner	it wouldn't be terrible if we set it to something like -j$(nproc)  but assuming anything else isn't fair.
2020-05-23 06:04:58	eschwartz	cflags are being set because that's how we expect binaries to be built by default, makeflags doesn't change artifact output

2020-10-06 17:20:55	navik	upgrading with --ignore on gnome-shell and mutter works; using xhost does not seem to be resolving the issue, so it's not central on the type of xsecurity, I guess.

2020-10-06 21:21:48	mpan	ice9: Xfce is similar to GNOME2. GNOME3 is totally different. And soon after it was released it was practically useless, so I needed to find GNOME2 replacement fast and Xfce was just fine. Supposedly GNOME3 got a bit better with time, but I also have no reason to return to it.

2020-10-06 22:01:38	Foxboron	No, this isn't about the patch. The patch is there to ensure qt compatability. That is removed on the update, but that in of itself isn't a bugreport worthy thing.
2020-10-06 22:01:49	Foxboron	It will be updated whenever the package maintainer finds the time

2020-10-21 04:58:32	aseo	Hi all, trying to install Arch on a Macbook Pro 14,1 (dual boot, with refind, on Catalina). When I turn on the laptop, the refind menu prompts me with an option to boot from "Fallback iso from arch_iso" and when I select that option, I get stuck in a black screen with a menu in the middle titled "Refind" and below saying something like "Now loading bootload.iso" or something like that. Anyone got any

The primary monitor is connected to the Displayport port and the secondary monitor is connected to the HDMI port. While both ports are listed in the Audio profiles and one can be chosen, for some reason the HDMI output is picked as the default and the OS switches to it when the computer goes to sleep and wakes up.

2020-10-22 00:18:32	level420	I was wondering, should something like qt take a while to compile with makepkg/yay?
2020-10-22 00:18:36	thurstylark	the same thing happening on another computer kind of makes me suspect hardware even more :/

2020-10-22 00:19:45	nairwolf	hello, i'm trying to understand which mode I have with my systemd-resolved. The wiki says there are four modes, and it depends on certain condition. But I have none of these conditions, and my DNS works. https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-resolved#DNS

2020-10-22 00:20:07	LBV_User	well, thanks for the directions anyway, when I get there again, I'll check the cables... It has been a long while I think they have power issues
2020-10-22 00:20:14	nairwolf	the first mode is when you have a symlink /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf towards /etc/resolv.conf, but I don't have it

2020-10-22 00:20:41	nairwolf	I don't have any symlink, and the /etc/resolv.conf is empty...
2020-10-22 00:20:52	thurstylark	LBV_User: i mean... yeah a bit :P I'm just used to USB disconnects/reconnects being hardware issues, either cables, hubs, or sometimes even my mobo, so that's my first guess. Feel free to stick around for other opinions, though :)

2020-10-22 00:21:52	nairwolf	thurstylark: ping archlinux.org seems to resolve

2020-10-22 00:23:00	LBV_User	thurstylark: well, it probably is hardware... last time, they complained the program was freezing, got there to discover they were smashing the keyboard cable and it was going nuts xD
