The system does have internal buttons on the tablet part. How likely is it that I'll be able to make Syslinux use them for selecting different boot options?

For kernel panic, you'd use the messages printed to the system console, which unfortunately aren't logged to syslog or anywhere (system is panicked and it can't write  them)

2019-12-08 23:30:03	Tassium	sounds more like a physical issue; either power (battery losing connection) or shorting out the mainboard (chassis flexing or something)

2019-12-17 01:42:33	freebds	Network Interface Bonding is a mechanism used in Linux servers which consists of binding more physical network interfaces in order to provide more bandwidth than a single interface can provide or provide link redundancy in case of a cable failure.
2019-12-17 01:42:57	BadBob	freebds:  so, suppose you have two 1-gigabit adapters in a host
2019-12-17 01:42:57	ayecee	freebds: okay, which part of that did you not understand?
2019-12-17 01:42:59	freebds	network interfaces the mean to say lan cards?

2019-12-17 01:43:22	BadBob	freebds:  you can combine them to get one 2-gigabit link (effectively)
2019-12-17 01:43:25	longxia	freebds: or rather a port on a lan card

2019-12-17 01:43:44	BadBob	freebds:  it's just combining multiple channels to get a single higher-speed channel
2019-12-17 01:43:51	freebds	so a lan card has a speed limit
2019-12-17 01:43:55	BadBob	freebds:  requires support on both ends of the connection, of course
2019-12-17 01:44:03	freebds	ok
2019-12-17 01:44:04	ayecee	yes, a lan card has a speed limit
2019-12-17 01:44:18	freebds	damn i fail at networking
2019-12-17 01:44:26	freebds	i should take a ccna course
2019-12-17 01:44:27	EdFletcherT137	even light itself has a speed limit. everything has a speed limit.
2019-12-17 01:44:28	ayecee	well not just networking
2019-12-17 01:45:01	freebds	?
2019-12-17 01:45:04	BadBob	Channel bonding is to networking what SMP is to computation

2019-12-17 01:47:59	BadBob	freebds:  right.  so you use multiple links, to get higher speed and/or higher reliability
2019-12-17 01:48:00	codeaholic	you can pushd more than once. pushd and popd are a stack of directories.
2019-12-17 01:48:07	BadBob	freebds:  it's the same idea as using RAID with disks

2019-12-17 01:49:26	BadBob	Guy1524:  just the file size?  then 'stat'

2019-12-17 01:50:06	Guy1524	because that differs from the in-memory size AFAIK
2019-12-17 01:50:10	ayecee	why would it
