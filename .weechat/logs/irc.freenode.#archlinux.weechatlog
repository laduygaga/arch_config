2019-12-09 04:54:21	sheep	a new kind of connector
2019-12-09 04:54:26	whislock	eXeC64: It's just a different method of generating an interface address as part of the SLAAC process.
2019-12-09 04:54:31	daria	not compatible with sata molex?
2019-12-09 04:54:39	grawity	daria: photo?
2019-12-09 04:54:48	daria	img is included

2019-12-09 04:55:04	daria	anyway i got to get one of those boxy looking ones then
2019-12-09 04:55:09	daria	with standard connectors?
2019-12-09 04:55:10	grawity	yeah that's M.2 and no it is not compatible with sata molex
2019-12-09 04:55:14	daria	ah
2019-12-09 04:55:22	daria	im limited to sata molex, ssd still an option rite?
2019-12-09 04:55:36	grawity	the more expensive M.2 SSDs aren't even SATA, they're PCIe (the M.2 port can carry both)
2019-12-09 04:55:47	daria	i see
2019-12-09 04:55:52	grawity	yeah I guess you're limited to usual 2.5" inch SATA SSDs
2019-12-09 04:55:57	grawity	but there's still plenty of those as well
2019-12-09 04:55:59	daria	okay thanks
2019-12-09 04:56:03	daria	those seem pricier tho
2019-12-09 04:56:30	grawity	hmm I thought usually M.2 ones are pricier
2019-12-09 04:56:37	daria	not in here

2019-12-09 04:56:51	eXeC64	Seems I've got addr_gen_mode=1 in sysctl. I don't understand how "1: do no generate a link-local address, use EUI64 for addresses generated from autoconf" is different from "0: generate address based on EUI64" Strange phrasing. The behaviour I see sounds much more like "2: generate stable privacy address, RFC7217"
2019-12-09 04:56:58	daria	i could probably fit one of those into a pci-e slot however not on a laptop

2019-12-09 04:58:38	grawity	maybe it's just supply/demand
2019-12-09 04:59:06	daria	well im planning to upgrade a few i3 based notebooks from around 2012
2019-12-09 04:59:13	grawity	like, I'm guessing "860 EVO" SATA M.2 is cheaper than its 2.5" variant because who the fuck wants to buy it if they can get a NVMe M.2 one instead?
2019-12-09 04:59:47	grawity	tbh, it is still standard SATA, so I wonder if there are adapters from M.2 to traditional SATA cabling
2019-12-09 05:00:01	daria	i would buy that

2019-12-09 05:00:39	grawity	I mean why not, it's very few components
2019-12-09 05:00:43	daria	more delivery costs tho so i should stick to sata connector ssd
2019-12-09 05:00:47	grawity	just like the NVMe M.2 to full-size PCIe adapters
2019-12-09 05:00:59	grawity	yeah I don't think you will save much in the end
