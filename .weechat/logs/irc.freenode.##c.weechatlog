2019-12-08 06:52:37	fizzie	Wee-ell. That really depends on what you're doing. I imagine most of the time when you care about days, you also care about local time. But that's super-inconvenient for calculating durations, because then not all days are of the same length.

2019-12-08 06:55:28	fizzie	An opaque "instant" (which is what time_t is) plus a bunch of conversion functions to go to/from instants and broken-down calendar times (with time zones) is a pretty reasonable time API.
2019-12-08 06:56:13	dave0	fizzie: i imagine it would be easier for the computer to say "yesterday" or "tomorrow" or "last monday" if you have the number of days

2019-12-08 06:57:16	fizzie	Not that the API choice can do much about the sort of edge cases like that.
2019-12-08 06:57:50	fizzie	Well, okay, "yesterday" probably has a definition, I meant to ask about "one day ago".

2019-12-08 07:02:51	fizzie	As far as C's time API is concerned, the closest it gets to that sort of calculations is that mktime accepts values that are outside the normal ranges, so you can just subtract one from tm_mday and call mktime on it, to get to "yesterday". (Though I'm not sure what it does for DST discontinuity.)
