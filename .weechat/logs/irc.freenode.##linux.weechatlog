2019-12-08 08:43:17	puff	I used this command to list my installed packages: sudo dpkg --get-selections > ~/packages.txt   But it listed a little under 5000 packages.

The system does have internal buttons on the tablet part. How likely is it that I'll be able to make Syslinux use them for selecting different boot options?
