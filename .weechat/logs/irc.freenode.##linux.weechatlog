2019-12-08 06:35:52	Sappos	Hm, make localmodconfig is apparently supposed to only be turning stuff off, so it should give some sensible result. (That would, however, not include any devices I've inadvertently turned off.)

2019-12-08 06:36:42	Dagmar	This is not a reasonable default
2019-12-08 06:36:46	ayecee	i still wonder about that myself after reading the recent vpn thingy.

2019-12-08 06:37:26	Dagmar	Then they could set it to loose mode and it would have been fine
2019-12-08 06:37:31	ayecee	the cve description is pretty clear that rp_filter setting isn't the problem, but rather that the loose rp_filter setting allowed them to see the real problem.

2019-12-08 06:38:08	Dagmar	ayecee: Except it's not a setting that should have been adopted by systemd as their default
2019-12-08 06:38:28	ayecee	sure, but that's not the cause of the vulnerability in the cve.
2019-12-08 06:38:48	ayecee	still puzzling though.
2019-12-08 06:39:02	Dagmar	These were expected behaviours prior to being declared a CVE
2019-12-08 06:39:19	ayecee	nope
2019-12-08 06:39:23	Dagmar	It's part of the reason I've been setting rp_filter to 1 on almost every multi-interface box I've made in the last 20+ years
2019-12-08 06:39:50	ayecee	like, this problem also applies to ipv6, which rp_filter doesn't address
2019-12-08 06:40:12	tds	nft and ip6tables can both do reverse path filtering for you if you want
