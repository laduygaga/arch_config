2019-12-08 23:19:45	__marco	Hello. I am using an Ubuntu Docker image as a building machine. Before running any job I update the OS via apt-get. For bionic and disco the update finishes smoothly but when I update eoan, the package tzdata asks for some input from the user to chose the geographic area. How can I say to dpkg-reconfigure (or whatever is running at that moment) to not ask for any input and maybe also to set up some sensible answer?

2019-12-09 00:22:06	Ether_Man	Hey. So I was wondering. If I replace the binaries of some installed packages. Would that cause any issues directly? (provided the replacement works and such ofc). And what happens when those packages need updating. Will it just overwrite the binaries or will it start complaining about no longer matching or something like that?
2019-12-09 00:22:15	rypervenche	Check: ssh-keygen -p -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
2019-12-09 00:22:28	rypervenche	Or whatever the path to your private key is.
2019-12-09 00:22:54	pragmaticenigma	Ether_Man: That would make your system unsupported in this channel. You should never replace the binaries or any files that are provided through a package repository.

2019-12-09 00:25:34	Ether_Man	pragmaticenigma: well I understand it would become unsupported though I figured I'd ask about how it would react.
