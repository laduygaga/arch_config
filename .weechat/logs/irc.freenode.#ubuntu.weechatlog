2019-12-08 08:57:41	hatsu	so i am trying to get my VM setup online
2019-12-08 08:57:51	hatsu	i'm wondering if it's a bad idea to do a storage-over-lan thing
2019-12-08 08:58:02	hatsu	like, i have a NAS attached and I have my VM image on the NAS itself
2019-12-08 08:58:20	hatsu	i'm wondering if it's a bad idea not to have a local image and serve the image up via samba
2019-12-08 08:58:33	pragmaticenigma	hatsu: Do you have a specific Ubuntu OS question? System organization and recommendations should be asked in #ubuntu-discuss or #ubuntu-offtopic please

2019-12-08 09:08:33	ducasse	no, there isn't
2019-12-08 09:08:39	pragmaticenigma	kinghat: The only way that I am aware to cast a monitor, is to use the Google Chrome browser's built in ability to cast a screen. You can consult the documentation for Google Chrome here: https://support.google.com/chromecast/answer/3228332?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en
