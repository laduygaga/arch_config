2019-12-09 02:34:38	willc	Have you ever had that time when you went to look in the drawer for a pair of scissors that are there 99.99999998% of the time, but then they're not there. Here you are looking into an empty drawer and feeling like an idiot because the only reason you looked for the scissors is because they are needed to do scissor things. No one else is there and you're wondering "who on earth moved the scissors?" - And then you start looking around the room, and then
2019-12-09 02:34:38	willc	start branching out into other rooms. Still nothing. "Where on earth are those scissors" - Annoyed you decide to descend into savagery by using a knife instead. Oof

2019-12-09 02:57:20	Rothstein	at first i thought man i have let myself go i am slowing down it is age
2019-12-09 02:57:21	Rothstein	but no
2019-12-09 02:57:27	Rothstein	then i notice the battery

2019-12-09 03:00:07	Rothstein	just bikes with some electric powerbank
2019-12-09 03:00:38	Rothstein	but then i ask myself why does this anger me at all
2019-12-09 03:00:47	Rothstein	and the conclusion is obvious
2019-12-09 03:00:51	willc	I wonder if Canada would use more ebikes if the weather permitted it year around. However the more rugged solution is an ebike

2019-12-09 03:02:02	willc	While driving I sometimes ask myself the same thing when someone passes me. Then I think to myself "Hey Moth, why are you racing to the flame?"
2019-12-09 03:02:15	Rothstein	mm

2019-12-09 03:02:52	Rothstein	and dont understand traffic lights
2019-12-09 03:03:21	willc	Perhaps that is why they are without a license ;) ha

2019-12-09 03:06:56	willc	You're not missing much.
2019-12-09 03:07:08	Rothstein	i mean i guess operation is not really a problem
2019-12-09 03:07:14	willc	Had you never been in a motorized vehicle there would be more questions.
2019-12-09 03:07:21	Rothstein	it is the other people on the road, which is to say traffic

2019-12-09 03:07:57	Rothstein	when a car would only slow you down
2019-12-09 03:08:20	Rothstein	then after that saw now point in even getting a license
2019-12-09 03:08:46	Rothstein	to be even more frank
2019-12-09 03:08:53	Rothstein	i am usually too drunk
2019-12-09 03:09:06	Rothstein	inebriated in any case
2019-12-09 03:09:17	Rothstein	but thats when uber came round

2019-12-17 03:32:14	@SeferYetzirah	According to Swami Vivekananda, the Shiva-linga had origins in the idea of Yupa-Stambha or Skambha of the Vedic rituals, where the term meant the sacrificial post which was then idealized as the eternal Brahman. The Yupa-Skambha gave place in time to the Shiva-Linga, quite possibly with influence from Buddhism's stupa shaped like the top of a stone linga, according to Vivekananda.[25][35]
